Module 1: Logistics Overview and Strategy

Section A Definitions

Order-to-delivery cycle: period of time when customer places an order and when customer receives the order

Logistics = Materials management + Distribution 

Inbound logistics functions: demand forecasting, purchasing, production planning, manufacturing inventory, raw materials and subassembly warehousing, materials handling.

Outbound logistics: finished goods/DC warehousing, finished goods inventory, materials handling, industrial packaging, distribution requirements planning, order processing, transportation, customer management

Systems concept emphasizes whole system vs individual parts

Total cost concept: all decision should favor a total reduction in cost, not just individual parts

Logistics costs: local delivery, primary transport, DC storage costs, inventory carrying, information system costs

Line haul: terminal to terminal

DC storage costs: economies of scale achieved with larger DCs

Inventory carrying costs: capital (physical inventory + financing + opportunity cost), storage (space + personnel + equipment), risk (insurance, pilferage, inventory deterioration, damage, obsolescence) 

Make-to-order: goods made after order receipt

Make-to-stock: products finished before receipt, production orders replenish stock

Assemble-to-order: assembled after order receipt, useful when there are common components

Suboptimization: Too narrow of a solution

Warehouse tradeoffs: #, how much inventory, full or selected assortments, size, layout and location relative to suppliers and customers

Inventory management: who controls re-ordering, how to reorder, verify accuracy of inventory levels

Import/export: customs expertise, local vs outsourced

Packaging: reusable or sustainable

Demand forecasting: early = less accurate, later = more accurate, less time to action

Purchasing: supplier distance, order size affects mode

Production planning: type of order (make to stock, etc)

Materials: efficient order picking must be considered, flow of warehouse

Order management: speeding up process can lower transportation costs

Logistics information systems: more information = less inventory

Customer management: balancing service levels and expectations, short lead times = more variability and cost

Four P’s: Product, price, place, promotion 

Product: size, weight, density, dimensions, packaging, displays

Price: too high = less sales, too low = less profit margins

Place: distribution channels, where to meet demand

Promotion: push = orderly demand from wholesalers, pull = less predictable (DTC)

Echelon: supply chain node (retailer, DC, supplier, etc)

SKU: stock keeping unit


Time utility: deliver not too early or late

Place utility: desired customer location

Possession utility: advertising SKUs and promoting desirability

Form utility: changing form of good through production process (break-bulking and mixing)

Quantity utility: right qty delivered, error free, matches demand

Information utility: ability of customer to communicate requirements

Service utility: customer receives right post-sale support via desired communication channel

Network design: responsive, agile, least amount of inventory, nearness to suppliers and customers, types of distribution channels

Inventory: maximize turnover (velocity)

Order processing: correct information, resolution of payment issues

Transportation: cost vs service level, type of carrier, minimum service levels

Warehousing, materials handling, packaging: manages equipment, labor and space

Drivers of logistics: cost vs customer service, needs, schedule compression, globalization, market trends, competition, complexity/risk, technology, triple bottom line, regulations/compliance, extreme weather and network failure

Home delivery implications: showcasing (shopping between retailers), night time deliveries decrease vehicle utilization, increased demand for parcel services, order picking has increased time and cost, high return % for online orders, grocery deliveries require temp control

Schedule compression: shortened product life cycles, increased focus to minimize inventory

Globalization: sourcing local vs international affects execution and costs


Market trends: 

-	towards omni-channel distribution models
-	mergers/acquisitions increased to spread fixed costs over more units
-	3PLs and economies of scale
-	growth in power of retailers over manufacturers
-	retailer power over logistics providers

Competition: emerging markets are followed by other companies

Complexity and risk:

-	Proliferation of SKUs
-	Regulatory or safety requirements that call for changes in materials handling, storage, or transportation processes
-	Process improvements or added duties, such as final assembly for postponement
-	Outsourcing to foreign countries with different cultures
-	Separate logistics systems for direct deliveries, retail, and reverse logistics
-	For global logistics, longer lead times, higher variability, and more transportation modes and intermodal transportation

Technology: 

-	Documentation 
-	blockchain - tracing each step of supply chain
-	AI - improving decision systems like demand management
-	Digital freight matching apps - automate tendering and shopping

The Triple Bottom Line: profitability, social and economic

Regulations: hazardous equipment, driver hours, tariffs

Extreme weather/network failure: contingency plans needed

Section B Definitions: The Role, Value and Cost of Logistics

Supply chain management = suppliers + logistics + customers

Stages of maturity

1.	Baseline: internal silos hinder integration, inventory buffers, handoffs, external relationships are transactional, logistics seen as cost center with poor cost control
2.	Functional integration: internal processes are integrated, buffer inventories still exist. Improvements and decisions are seperate.
3.	Internal Integration: logistics is integrated, elimites buffer inventories except for raw materials and finished goods.
4.	External integration: inventory is minimized with information, demand generation and fulfillment are integrated


Channel master: partner with the most power in relationships that creates trends

Comparative advantage: country A can produce more units than country B

Economic impact of logistics: countries that invest in infrastructure see lower transportation costs as % of GDP

Landed cost: product + warehousing + transportation + handling fees. Sourcing closer to demand can assist with lowering it. 

Law of squares (Lardner’s law): any reduction in transportation cost will be directly proportional to the increase in the market area where product can be sold competitively. EX: cutting costs in half, doubles the radius you can serve. 

Increase inventory turnover = increase economic value of logistics

Average inventory = units sold /  cycle time + safety stock. EX: 100/units per day, 10 day cycle time = 1,000 units. Divide by 2 = 500 average inventory. If cycle time is reduced from 10 to 5, 500 units / 2 = 250 average inventory.

Reducing cycle time from 104 to 61 days would save $30 billion in the grocery industry.

Impacts of globalization:

-	Higher customer expectations - ecommerce
-	Exports of finished goods vs subassembly components increasing
-	Larger containerships
-	Countries now have low cost, highly skilled labor
-	Reduced trade barriers
-	EU’s deregulation increases transit times
-	3PL technology improving

Challenges:

-	Tariffs/regulations of different countries lead to more time/expertise/costs
-	Cultural differences hinder trade agreements
-	Bribery
-	Terrorism
-	Infrastructure poor in some areas

E-commerce: increased D2C sales via internet, increased final mile carrier capacity, 3PLs under pressure = less logistics players in market
Topic 2: The Value of Logistics Management

Logistics manager duties

-	Clearly explaining desired end result
-	Trusting person to do the work independently
-	Challenge status quo

Leadership

-	Trait model - charisma, passion and decisiveness. Drawback is that the candidate may be less technical.
-	Process-based model - recognizing issues/problems, assemble right team, supporting collaboration, and gathering feedback. May not challenge status quo

Logistics competitive advantages 

-	reduce cost of transportation, labor and inventory
-	improve customer service levels while maintaining profitability
-	It’s cohesive bond between sales, procurement and production

How to create a competitive advantage:

-	Efficiency - lowest cost provider of logistics to compete on price through high asset utilization, high inventory turnover, minimal inventory. Automated workflows exist too
-	Agility - able to scale based on demand signals
-	Resilience - withstand disruptions through diversification
-	Customer focus - aims to have best in class service levels: perfect order fulfillment, satisfaction, post-sale support
-	Responsiveness
-	Quality
-	Experience
-	Complexity competence - import/export terms

Promoting efficiency: level production despite demand peaks. Can be accommodated by:
-	Extra warehousing capacity
-	Produce goods in peak demand in opposite season
-	Produce goods with steady demand year round
-	Contract warehousing to flex capacity
-	Rent warehouse space to organization with opposite demand profile


Reducing costs

-	Reducing costs creates more leverage than increasing revenues
-	EX: $10 item
-	$6/unit (variable)
-	$300,000 (fixed)
-	Selling 100,000 units = $1,000,000 revenue - $600,000 variable costs - $300,000 fixed = $100,000 profit
-	10% increase in sales (110,000 units) = $1,100,000 revenue and $660,000 variable costs - $300,000 fixed = $140,000 profit
-	Reduction of 10% in variable cost = 100,000 units, $1,000,000 revenue, $540,000 variable costs, $300,000 fixed = $160,000 profit (60% increase
-	Factors
	-	Supplier locations
	-	Inventory locations relative to demand
	-	Transportation bids
	-	Human resources
	-	Information systems 
	-	Inventory carrying cost
	-	Turnover

Increasing Customer Satisfaction and Service Levels

-	Continuous improvement 
-	Adjust logistics cost and service to customer

Topic 3: Logistics Costing

Traditional accounting obscures the impact of inventory and  transportation - two largest sources of logistics costs

Inbound = included in COGS

Outbound = operating expense, not included in gross profit figure, shipment pricing can be bundled together, which obscures expenses

Fixed cost = Expenditure that does not vary with production volume: rent, property tax, salaries

Variable cost = changes directly with one unit of production
-	Direct cost = variable costs associated with job or operation 

Indirect cost = costs not directly incurred by an operation, such as plant heating

Direct material = material that becomes part of final product in measurable quantities 

Direct labor = Labor applied to good being manufactured or used in the performance of a service

Contribution margin = sales revenue - variable costs

Contribution = sales price - variable costs

Variable cost of goods sold = direct materials, direct labor, supplies

Variable direct cost
-	Discounts and promotions
-	Sales bonuses and commissions
-	Variable customer management costs
-	Other volume-based selling and admin expenses

Variable gross profit - variable direct cost = contribution margin

Opportunity cost = return on capital that could have resulted if capital had been used somewhere else

Net profit approach = determines net profit of each element (does not effectively measure logistics costs)
-	Example: 

Activity based costing = costs driven by activities that consume resources

Direct costs = in ABC, a cost that can be tracked, like units produced, production line, department or manufacturing plant 

Tracing = connecting resources to activities to cost objects

Cost object = anything for which a separate cost measurement is desirable. Product, customer, project, or other work unit

Driver = operation that influences the quality of work and cost




Examples of drivers:

-	Warehousing - pallet bays used, hours consumed
-	Palletized: qty of cartons
-	Put-away: cubic volume
-	Order picking: qtys, number of visits to pick location, number of lines
-	Supervision: supervisor hours
-	Transportation: number of deliveries and distance traveled

How to determine cost rates:	

-	Classify activities
-	Estimate cost of each activity
-	Determine unit rate per pick (salary of pickers / units picked)

Throughput accounting = because every system has a constraint that limits global performance, impact can be measured in context of global measures
-	Used to expense logistics equipment


Theory of constraints accounting = throughput, inventory and operating expense

Net profit = (sales revenue - true variable costs) - operating expenses

-	Net profit = throughput - operating expenses


Section B Quiz

Question 1

How did shift from logistics to supply chain affect how inventory is perceived? Shifted towards it becoming a strategic decoupling point - improve information flow, match demand

Question 2

What role was added on to logistics as supply chain management evolved? Externally integrated information systems


Question 3

What is the disadvantage of local deliveries + local production (high costs) vs sourcing in a low labor region?

Competitors will have a cost advantage globally

Question 4

Activity based costing

Type A - $.30 per pick, 5000 units
Type B - $.40 per pick, 3000 units
Type C - $.50 per pick, 1000 units

What percent of costs is in type C?

5000*.30 + 3000*.40 + 1000 *.5 =  3200

Type C (500) / 3200 = .15625 =  15.6%



Question 5

What is a leading indicator of a low-labor country not remaining? Economic success on a macro level

Question 6

What is a market pressure on 3PLs that move TL and LTL? Direct to consumer trends threaten model
	
Question 7

If an organization wants to be customer focused, what should it do?

Be different things for different customers




Question 8

Company is deciding whether or not to invest in a new fleet. If operating at full capacity, revenue would increase from 200,000 to 300,000 per month. If drivers need to make fewer runs and will idle 10% of the time, what amount of revenue should be used for calculation?

300,000 * .10 = 30,000
300,000 - 30,000 = $270,000

Question 9

Why are traditional accounting methods less useful for logistics costing?

Insurance costs for inventory are grouped with other types of insurance.

Question 10

Why use activity based costing? (per unit measured)

Fairer way to distribute costs among customers

Question 11

What is a good option if high fuel costs are making a products landed cost higher than the price consumers are willing to pay?

Move operations to a location closer to demand

Question 12

What needs to be leverage in order to gain true benefits of supply chain management?

Logistical networks of customers and suppliers - prevents duplicating efforts





Question 13

What is a primary factor that can result in higher logistics costs as a percentage of gross domestic product?

Aggregate inventory levels


Question 14

What is a factor that would require having higher levels of customer service in logistics vs other industries?

Highly substitutable goods - backorders lead to lost sales in competitive environment

Question 15

What is a key leadership skill that can be learned?

Ability to admit mistakes

Question 16

How would a company that uses near sourcing to reduce logistics costs could break into distance markets?

Near-source separately in each key market

Question 17

What receives stronger emphasis in supply chain management than in logistics?

Strategic planning

Question 18

What action by a logistics manager would empower his or her employees?

Have employees participate in setting performance targets



Question 19

Source closer to the point of demand




Question 20

What is the most effective way to increase an organization’s profits?

Reduce transportation costs by 10%

Question 21

What is a good way to increase the profitable service area for a DC?

Decrease transportation costs to the DC

Question 22

Company A - contribution margin: $500,000, fixed costs: $150,000 
Company B - contribution margin: $300,000, fixed costs: $80,000, indirect costs: $200,000

If customer B was dropped, what would be change to net profit?

Company A contribution margin: $500,000 - $150,000 = $350,000
Company B contribution margin: $300,00 - $80,000 = $220,000
$350,000 + $220,000 = $570,000 - fixed indirect costs of $200,00 = $370,000

Customer B $350,000 - fixed indirect costs of $200,000 = $150,000. $370,000 - $150,000 = $220,000 drop in profits.

Need to know net profit.


Question 23

Warehouse at $200,000 in fixed costs. $10/unit in variable costs. Half of the costs direct/indirect. 5,000 pallets in storage, what is cost per pallet?

$20,000 / 5,000 pallets = $40 per pallet + $10 per pallet = $50 per pallet


Strategic plan = mission, goals, objectives, and actions needed to achieve

Strategic (3-5 months):
-	Capital expenditures /  projected operating costs
-	Customer service levels
-	Distribution channels
-	Supply locations
-	Manufacturing
-	Warehouse types, sizes, numbers
-	Transportation modes
-	Make or buy
-	Inventory levels
-	Delivery methods



Tactical (6-12 months):
-	Warehouse
-	Layout
-	Space
-	Storage types (racks)
-	Inventory location method
-	Inventory control
-	Materials handling
-	Handling process
-	Handling equipment types
-	Unit loads
-	Inbound/outbound
-	Mode
-	Carriers

Logistics strategies
-	Generic
-	Cost leadership
-	Differentiation
-	Focus
-	Customer service
-	Group by segment
-	Bowersox / Daughtery
-	Process - reduce cost through lean
-	Market - reduce complexity
-	Information - share info to increase cohesion and external partner collaboration

Example goals to increase return on capital:
-	Order-to-delivery cycle of 10 days or less
-	Fulfillment lead time of 3 days or less
-	Inventory days of supply of 15 days of less

Objectives
-	Network integration - information that drives inventory strategy, transportation service requirements, network design, # of DCs, automation
-	Inventory 
-	Levels - nonproductive inventory
-	Turnover 
-	Transportation - mode selection to minimize cost, short local deliveries, effective use of 3PLs
-	Variance reduction - provides shorter order cycle time, lower safety stock
-	Agility - how to scale capacity
-	Product life cycle support / reverse logistics - introduction, growth, maturity, decline, returns, recalls and recycling. Returns are a huge drain on profit
-	Quality - Damage, incorrect deliveriest
-	Customer service and responsiveness

Topic 3: cost and service optimization

-	Availability
-	Operational performance
-	Service reliability

Innovative thinking

-	Shipment consolidators
-	Delaying shipments to consolidate orders (accepting long lead times and higher inventory)
-	Partnerships with others with same origin-destination pairings
-	Long-term contracts with package services to control cost 

Dwell: duration of time between cargo arrives in a terminal’s in-transit storage and when it is shipped by clearance transportation




Systems Perspective

-	Represented as a diagram:
o	Airport
o	Seaport
o	Warehouse
o	Market
o	Plant
-	Links connect nodes


Total cost of ownership: sum of all costs associated with every activity of the supply stream: 

-	Purchase cost – price per unit from suppliers
-	Production cost – cost per unit of direct materials, direct labor, and factory overheard
-	Landed cost - product + warehousing + transportation + handling fees
-	Monitoring/control costs

Items typically omitted from TCO:

-	Financing and opportunity costs
-	Sales and marketing
-	Administrative
-	Reverse logistics
-	Insurance and risk management
-	Taxes / foreign exchange

Post-transaction costs (might be included in TCO):

-	Requirements for research
-	Product development
-	Contract sourcing
-	Plant opening/closings
-	Hiring/layoffs
-	Supplier education
-	System integration






Ongoing costs of TCO

-	Life cycle – quality, durability, maintainability vs price
-	Costs of quality – defects, repairs, rework, returns, warranties
-	Sustainability costs – recycling, recovery of materials
-	Customer service and reputation costs (support, lost customers)

Total cost minimization

-	Simplified model - # of DC points and transportation costs
-	Companies often ignore effects of long lead times and associated carrying costs
o	EX: Sourcing copper in Brazil, South Korea, China and US is cheapest in China, but the short lead times in US had the lowest costs.

Make or buy cost analysis: deciding to produce an item internally or buy from outside supplier. Factors: costs, capacity, proprietary, knowledge, quality considerations, skill requirements, volume, and timing. 

Outsourcing: process of having suppliers provide goods and services that were previously provided internally.

Insourcing: using firm’s resources to provide goods or services

Subcontracting: sending production work outside to another manufacturer

Make-or-buy considerations:

-	Core competency?
-	Consequences of lost skills and knowledge?
-	Landed cost or TCO?
-	What is the break-even point?

Core competency: skills or knowledge sets that provide greatest level to its customers that is difficult to outsource or subcontract out

Consequences of lost skills and knowledge: many companies insource many functions because outsourcing is risky due to less control of customer experience. 





Landed cost or TCO, factors to consider:

-	Control – quality, processes, sustainability
-	Customer focus and responsiveness
-	Risk management – risk of IP theft, litigation, damage to reputation

Offshore outsourcing case study (TCO): 70% reduction in labor costs, increased transportation costs of 20%, increased monitoring and control costs of 20$ = net reduction in costs of 30%

TCO factors favoring a buy decision:

-	Agility – respond to demand
-	Resilience
-	Reduced capital expenditures
-	Better focus on core competencies
-	New ideas
-	Access to new markets
-	Expertise and complexity management

Break-even analysis: study of number of units or time to recoup an investment

-	EX: 
o	Plant costs $10 million, Variable cost = $25/unit
o	Buy from vendor = $0 fixed costs, $35 in variable costs
o	$35-25 = $10/unit
o	$10,000,000 / $10/unit = 1,000,000 units to break even
-	If demand > 1,000,000 = make
-	If demand < 1,000,000 = buy 

Topic 4: contracting and budgeting

Steps in contracting process
1.	Begin with goal in mind and document plans
2.	Analyze strategic imperatives – core competencies
3.	Analyze costs of current state
4.	Select providers
a.	Define requirements
b.	Identify type
c.	Locate and research potential providers
d.	Request RFP
e.	Evaluate and compare responses
f.	Select a contractor and negotiate
g.	Finalize contract
5.	Implement contract
6.	Reorganize internal process and transition staff
7.	Manage contract relationships
a.	Develop strategic, tactical and operational goals
b.	Feedback channels
c.	Measure performance in both directions
d.	Improve service through continuous improvement

Budgeting methods

-	Static – based on expected demand and capacity level
-	Flexible budget (expense) – dynamically adjusts to changes in sales and demand for logistics services
-	Rolling budget – Budget that is revised every 12 to 18 months

Important budgets for logistics

-	Capital – determines long-term funding for projects (build property, plant, software)
-	Logistics operating budget – determines necessary expenditures to deliver service level.
-	Cash budget – control timing of cash flows

Budgeting process:

1.	Set objectives and policies
2.	Analyze capacity and resources in a gap analysis
3.	Update and clearly communicate parameters
4.	Coordinate and review sub budget development
5.	Get final budget approval
6.	Distribute and communicate the importance of the budget

Setting goals – minimum, expected, or likely and stretch (motivates continuous improvement)

Cash budget:

-	Cash receipts (actual inflows)
-	Cash disbursements (outflows)
-	Cash surplus or deficit
-	Financing – borrowings or repayments to cover deficits

Customer segmentation

-	Least profitable business sectors = minimum level of service
-	Delivery channel 
-	Product – mode of transportation, warehousing
o	Bulk materials – liquids, grains
o	Size and shape – pallet or floor loaded
o	Temperature – type of truck
o	Value – insurance, mode, risk
o	Variety – risk of high inventory
o	Hazardous goods – compliance, insurance
o	Cross-contamination – segregate chemicals, etc

Product life cycles

1.	Development – research, design, testing, finalization, specs (for unit load sizes and costs)
2.	Introduction – high cost with low sales = negative profits
3.	Growth – sales increase, distribution expands, make to stock begins, 3PL warehousing needed, risk of too much inventory of demand signal inaccurate
4.	Maturity – most profitable, sales increase but slower
5.	Decline – market is saturated, declining demand, declining production, transition to make to order strategy to avoid excessive inventory

Life cycles and suppliers

-	Regulations require tracing materials back to their source
-	Establish way to handle returns and communicate improvements
-	Suppliers with shorter part life cycles than product can limit supply

Reverse logistics
-	Warranties
-	Space parts
-	Returns

Section D: Logistics Framework Notes


Types of organizational structures:

-	Functional structure with no logistics functional area – series of grain silos, where there is suboptimization and slow transfer of information. 
-	Functional structure with logistics functional area – other departments have no say in managing logistics. High cooperation is required.
-	Matrix – Director + supply chain + logistics 
-	Network – Process focused, from order receipt to delivery. Agile and reliant on information sharing.

Centralized (organized, shipping volume discounts) vs decentralized (more responsive to          customer)

Echelon: levels of supply chain nodes, focused on warehousing. Good for wide arrays of products

Direct: minimal warehouse #, inventory, direct shipping to demand.

Combined: uses both echelons and direct. Fast moving items are sent to echelons (close to customers) and slow-moving items are at centralized warehouse for direct delivery.

Flexible: Allow warehouse to communicate and share workloads. 

	Examples:

-	Ship a back order from a more distant warehouse.
-	Customer is equidistant from two warehouse, ship from highest inventory or capacity to balance workload.
-	Stock a master facility with a full line of products, support smaller warehouses with limited inventory. 
-	Cross-docking: Time orders from manufacturers to align outbound orders
-	Integrated service providers: can hold slow moving inventory, consolidation

Logistics relationships:
 
-	Contract: End date with no guarantee with penalties and termination causes
-	Ongoing relationship: contract, but with more information sharing and goals.
-	Leader/follower: supply chain integration started by channel master
-	Strategic alliance: integration through joint investments that increases performance of all companies involved. 
-	Enterprise extension: parties integrate processes, cultures, and information
Factors

-	Trust
-	Leadership
-	Power
-	Risk
-	Information sharing and visibility 

Types of collaboration:

-	Horizontal: suppliers share retailers so they share a warehouse
-	Quick response: JIT replenishment with high turnover from high changeovers. Fast transportation used.
-	Efficient: smooth flow between manufacturers and retailers, minimizes inventory using cross-docking, vendor-managed inventory
-	Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment
o	Strategy and planning: product mixes
o	Demand and supply management: forecast demand data and replenish together
o	Execution: order fulfillment and monitoring KPIs
o	Vendor-managed inventory (VMI): gives manufacturer responsibility for restocking its products, reduces bullwhip effect, more information on retail demand

Topic 3: Strategic Risk management

Supply chain risk: variety of possible events that can affect goods, services, funds or information resulting in quantitative or qualitative loss.

Risks
-	Tolerant vs averse to risk – set at organization strategy level 
-	Demand 
o	Low demand
o	Lower price than expected
-	Supply
o	Cost of material + labor higher than expected
o	Recalls or strikes
o	External relationships do not deliver promises or have unethical behavior.
-	Process 
o	Service failures or capacity constraints
o	Dysfunctional internal structures – silos, adversarial cultures, disjointed information systems
o	Failure to communicate strategic plans or demand data due to oversight or mistrust.
-	Financial risk
o	Your org or partner could experience financial failure
o	Currency exchange, the economy or credit availability
-	Environmental
o	Supply chain disruptions – disasters, war, or terrorism
o	Government regulations, interference, failure to invest in infrastructure, or instability.

Strategy opportunities and risks

Lean

-	Opportunities: less waste and buffer inventory
-	Risks: more stockouts or line stoppage after disruption

Few suppliers:

-	Opportunities: economies of scale
-	Risks: increases supply risk due to disaster or financial failure, quality recalls would result in widespread issues, replacing suppliers takes time

Low-count country sourcing
	
-	Opportunities: low labor costs
-	Risks: long lead times, IP theft, government appropriation

Contracting

-	Opportunities: focus on core competencies and cut costs
-	Risks: operations less visible, harder to coordinate

Supply chain security

-	Warehouse pilferage: No exceptions to warehouse yard access. Single gate. Rotate assignments. Audit case counts.

-	Truck hijacking: Instruct staff to hand over keys, avoid high-risk routes, technology 

-	Damage: Pallet-stacking limits, separate items in loads to prevent cross-contamination, proper packaging




Compliance

-	Customs regulations: classify goods properly, paying fair value, correct markings and labeling. Import/export regulations exist to collect taxes, ban illegal or substandard and prevent trade dumping. 
-	Prohibited goods: Limited for import/export between countries due to national interest or security concerns
-	Country of origin tracking: Regulations that help orgs qualify for beneficial product labeling (“Made in…” and trade agreement tax discounts
-	Air freight regulations: regulated by the international air transport association (IATA) and the international civil aviation organization (ICAO). Countries can restrict # of flights.
-	Trucking regulations: limit noise at night, driver time, ban trucks in certain areas
-	Rail regulations: rates, services issues, line sales, mergers and acquisitions, line abandonments, classifications, facilities, interchange traffic among carriers---- regulated by the Surface Transportation Board.
-	Safety Regulations:
o	FMCSA – motor carriers
o	US Coast guard – maritime safety
o	States – highways, traffic laws
o	Federal – Vehicle weight and trailer length
-	Anti-terrorism: Additional screening is needed, though partnerships like the Authorized Economic Operator program make it easier to cross

Social mandates
-	Voluntary initiatives
-	Consumer pressure – labor, environmental protections, treatment of local populations

Strategic risk tools
-	Identifying and managing exceptions
o	Determine gaps between desired and actual strategy 
▪	Internal - from change in business direction, merger or acquisition, internal resistance, complexity due to cultural differences
▪	External – disruptive technology, change in market, faster change in product’s life cycle
o	How to close gaps
▪	Reward critics for speaking up through anonymous surveys or brainstorming sessions
▪	Assign someone to analyze larger trends
-	Limiting complexity
o	Outsourcing imports and customs clearance
o	Fewer SKUs



SWOT analysis – strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats

-	Internal strengths and weaknesses: skill sets, reputation, input from customers and suppliers
-	External opportunities and threats: market trends, risk analysis, demographic change, customer needs, competitor pricing and offerings, emerging technology, taxes, laws, regulations
o	PESTEL – political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, environmental, and legal

Talent Acquisition and Management

Hierarchy of needs

-	Self-actualization – challenging work, growth
-	Esteem – reputation, recognition
-	Social – belonging
-	Safety – work environment, job security, useful benefits
-	Physiological needs – earnings, breaks

Survey of priorities
	
1.	Pay
2.	Challenging work
3.	Work-life balance
4.	Working with a talented team
5.	Appreciation for work
6.	Training/professional development


Talent 
-	Logistics professional shortage (especially drivers)
o	Turnover leads higher expenses passed on to the customer
-	Certification should be encouraged
-	Quality of management directly impacts retention
-	Warehouse manager should only manage 12 to 15 employees, exceeding labor will diminish their role.

Section F: Reengineering and Continuous Improvement

Improving an existing process or system
-	Reengineering – involves project management
-	Continuous improvement – step by step process to make work more efficient

Business process reengineering (BPR) – procedure that involves rethinking of business 

 



Continuous replenishment – supplier is notified of daily sales to avoid stockouts resulting an improvement in inventory turnover

Demand = predictable, lead time = long --- lean + make-to-stock

Demand = unpredictable, lead time = short --- agile methods

Demand = unpredictable, lead time = long ----agile + lean (leagile) which increases safety stocks

Lean production – minimization of all resources including time
-	Eliminate waste
o	Design 
o	Production
o	Supply chain management
-	Must be adopted by everyone

Just-in-time(JIT) 

-	Zero inventories
-	Short, consistent lead times
-	Small and frequent replenishment of inventoryu
-	High quality

Forms of waste

-	Transportation – excessive movement of people, things or information
-	Inventory – Storage of materials prior to demand signal
-	Motion – unnecessary handling, walking, driving, bending, lifting, reaching or turning
-	Waiting – idle time caused by lack of direction, instructions, information, parts or equipment
-	Overproduction – make more than immediately required
-	Overprocessing – higher-grade materials or tighter tolerances than required
-	Defects – Scrap, rework and erroneous documentation
-	Skills – worker underutilization or empowerment beyond capabilities


Japanese terms

-	Muda – activities that consume resources but create no customer value
-	Mura – demand or activities that are inconsistent or uneven
-	Muri – overburdening of works or processes

Push vs pull

-	JIT systems want to be pull, not push, though push is often required
-	Push 	
o	Traditional make-to-stock, forecasts are often wrong
-	Pull
o	Kanban – system of cards to signal demand
o	Customer > retailer > suppliers(s)

Agile Supply Chains: ability to respond quickly to unpredictable changes in customer needs by configuring operations. Orgs want to be agile because:

-	Demand and product requirements are unstable
-	Product lift cycles are short
-	Inventory becomes obsolete
-	Customer high expectations

Agile systems:

-	Require data sharing between echelons
-	Minimal finished goods inventory
-	Minimal lead times
-	Direct factory delivery to customer when possible
-	Collaborate production planning
-	Light manufacturing or geographic postponement within distribution 

Postponement: intentionally delays final production (assembly, production, packaging, tagging) until the latest time in the process to reduce risk

-	Light manufacturing – org needs to have sufficient space for good flow through
-	Geographic – moves inventory to key DCs but final delivery is triggered by demand

Lean plus agile – long lead times and unpredictable demand 

Six sigma – methodology to decrease process variation and improve product quality

-	Customer – performance, reliability, competitive price, on-time delivery, excellent service.
-	Process – Flowcharting process from outside looking in. reduce errors and variability. 
-	Employee – offer training at all levels



Sig sigma process and tools

-	Define – determine nature
-	Measure -existing performance vs data
-	Analyze – determine root cause
-	Improve – develop solutions
-	Control – monitor process until solutions are engrained

Continuous improvement: act of making incremental, regular improvements and upgrades to a process or product

Continuous process improvement: never-ending effort to expose and eliminate root causes of problems 

Kaizen: japanese term from improvement

Cost of poor quality: costs associated with performing a task incorrectly and/or generating unacceptable output. These costs would include the cost of noncomformities, inefficient, and lost opportunities

CPI steps:

-	Reducing variability in lead times
-	Improving a picking route

Plan-do-check-action (PDCA): 

1.	Plan
2.	Do
3.	Check
4.	Action

Continuous steps:

1.	Determine the process to be improved
2.	Gather and compile data on the as-is state
3.	Analyze the data and produce a to-be state
4.	Select the best method among alternatives
5.	Implement
6.	Sustain the new method




Continuous objectives

-	Improve quality
-	Improving productivity
-	Eliminating waste

Cost of poor quality: costs associated with doing a task incorrectly, which include nonconformities, inefficient processes and lost opportunities.

Employee involvement: uses experience, creative energy and intelligence by treating them with respect, keeping them informed and including them in decision-making processes.

Employee empowerment: practice of giving non-managerial employees the responsibility and the power to make decisions. 

Root cause analysis: ishikawi diagram is a tool to help determine root causes.

Value stream mapping visualizes flow of materials from supplier to customer, including all value and non-value-added time. Reduces waste, decreases flow time, make the process flow more efficient and effective
























Section F Quiz

Question 1

Which is a lean principle that relies on relinquishing hierarchical authority?

Culture of continuous improvement

Question 2

Which is an objective of lean?

Question 3

What should an org do if 3.4 defects per million opportunities is not feasible and customers do not expect that service level?

Customize goals that are ambitious given what is feasible and customer-accepted.

Question 4

What kind of waste would be easiest to identify by studying the bottom portion of a value stream map?

Waiting

Question 5

Which might be considered a form of waste under lean?

Performing quality control on incoming raw materials

Question 6

Which type of inventory might be relatively higher than normal in an agile system?

Work-in-process - manufacturing postponement

Question 7

Demand is roughly 500,000 and 800,000 units. Profit margins are low. Which solution would improve margins with fewest tradeoffs?

Produce 500,000 units in a low-labor-cost country and ship by ocean; then near-source remaining demand at agile facilities.

Question 8

Logistics professionals have been overburdened with expediting shipments, and this has led to a decrease in perfect orders. Using lean's problem-solving approach to waste, which is the most likely root cause of this issue?

Demand or activities that are inconsistent or uneven (mura)

Question 9

A manufacturing process is labor- and equipment-intensive, down to the final steps. The organization has put all product documentation online so there are no country-specific differences between products. What agile technique can the organization use if it has short lead times but high demand uncertainty?

Geographic postponement

“Geographic postponement moves inventory to key distribution centers (DCs), but forward deployment to the final DC or retail location is postponed until customer orders trigger the movements.”








Question 10

An organization wants to set up a kaizen team to implement a kaizen blitz in order to address inefficiencies and waste in the order management process, since it is adding to an already long lead time. Customer service has been handling complaints, sales wants to expedite orders quite often, and manufacturing and procurement want to be notified of orders sooner. Which is a best practice for this kaizen team?

Keep the team as small as possible, perhaps involving only IT and order management professionals.

Question 11

Which might be part of your job as a logistics professional if your organization adopts lean manufacturing?

Determining an efficient way to customize a logistics service for one customer

Question 13

Which would be unacceptable in an organization that has fully embraced lean or a similar continuous improvement philosophy?

Publicly berating an employee for missing a deadline

Question 14

What might be needed in a supply chain that uses "leagile" due to long lead times and highly unpredictable demand?

Safety stock


Question 15

Using six sigma languages, at least how many chances of a defect exist with perfect order fulfillment?


Product: The product ordered is the product provided.

Quantity: The product ordered is provided in the ordered quantity.

Delivery: The location and delivery time ordered are met upon receipt.

Customer order: The product is delivered to the specified entity.

Documentation supporting the order: All documents are accurate, complete, and on time.

Product condition: The product is delivered and faultlessly installed (as applicable) according to 
specifications with no damage, is customer-ready, and is accepted by the customer.

Question 16

Which is a tradeoff of pursuing responsiveness that postponement tries to mitigate?

Loss of economies of scale from having shorter production runs

Question 17

An organization has to have long lead times because the goods it sells are low margin and have many competitors. The high competition and high substitutability among brands means that demand is also highly unpredictable. What type of supply chain would be best for this organization?

“Leagile”

Question 18

Which is an example of a lean objective put into practice?

Warehouse pickers wear walking chronometers and compete on fewest steps per line item picked. ----reduces waste 



















Retail Compliance

Background

ADX Theriac decided to push these standards out to their U.S.–based ADX stores. ADX Theriac started using an on-time in full (OTIF) policy with monthly compliance targets of 65 percent for all LTL orders and 85 percent for all TL orders starting January 1. Compliance requires an order to arrive (complete) within a two-day window, neither too early nor too late. Reliability Logistics is in charge of ensuring that their portion of the deliveries are in compliance and for enforcing compliance with the suppliers and carriers who make deliveries to their DCs. Failures on the part of Reliability or the carriers and suppliers they work with results in a penalty of 3 percent of the invoice, a cost that is shared with the responsible party.

At the end of the first month, Reliability and its supply chain partners are in compliance with the LTL orders, but TL orders are at 80 percent and are noncompliant. Supply chain and senior leadership meet to address this problem and explore possible solutions or changes in strategy. Several avenues for further exploration are determined:

What information is needed from the retailer, and how can we better partner with ADX Theriac to get better data?

How can we align the supply chain to achieve these goals? The supply chain includes Reliability Logistics’ warehousing, order management, and local delivery, plus third-party carriers used for line-haul transport and the supply chain planning and operations of multiple suppliers.
Are our suppliers’ order fill rates acceptable, or do they need to improve operations?
How can we ensure that any changes we make will actually result in fewer cases of noncompliance?

What is the cost ramification to make these changes, and how does this compare to being charged the 3 percent penalty?

Questions & Answers

When delving into the question of what information is needed from the retailers, what information is likely to be of the most use in reducing the risk of noncompliance?

Details on the retailers’ rules of trade, for example, how they mark specific deliveries as compliant versus noncompliant





ADX Theriac wants Reliability Logistics to be capable of just-in-time rapid deliveries, especially for hot new products such as the CBD oils they plan to start aggressively selling. Which is the most viable solution that would also minimize the final price of the product to customers?


Set cycle stocks of CBD oils at Reliability’s DCs equal to one full order for each retail store served by that DC

Reliability Logistics decides to look into the CBD oil manufacturer’s recent incomplete order delivery. What is the most important thing to look into from a future retail compliance perspective?

Whether they have the available manufacturing capacity to meet the required order fill rate

What sort of change management would serve Reliability Logistics the best to get everyone aligned to this “new world order”?

Pull together a cross-functional team with expertise from this and other supply chain partners who will craft a cohesive message selling the importance of everyone doing their part.

The cross-functional team weighs the costs of replacing some logistics information systems to better align with the retailers’ systems and reconfiguring other systems to include retail compliance rules. The team determines that this will cost the equivalent of six months’ worth of penalties. They estimate that if no change is made they will have penalties in half the months of the year. What should the team recommend to senior management?

Make the change despite the high cost, since accumulating penalties is likely to eventually prompt ADX Theriac to find a new logistics partner.
















Module 2: Logistics Network Design

Topic 3: Transportation requirements and network size

Business strategy and customer requirements

-	EX: 90% of customers getting their goods within 72 hours of order receipt at an average fill rate of 94%
-	Adjusting how many and how far warehouses are to demand affects service levels

Steps:

1.	Determine customer requirements and network servicing expectations
a.	Identify customer segments
b.	Min/max service levels 
c.	Frequency of orders
2.	Calculate the threshold service level
a.	Cheapest method to serving all customers given transportation cost, safety stock, delivery timing and frequency
b.	Economic cost map visualizes cost breakdown of DC
3.	Use sensitivity analysis to adjust factors one at a time and determine the incremental cost difference of increasing any given factor 
a.	Changing one variable to see system change
b.	Cost of safety follows the square root rule
i.	Estimates impact on safety stock of adding/deleting warehouses
c.	Pareto analysis: 
i.	A = 96%
ii.	B = 92%
iii.	C = 85%
4.	Present the alternatives and their cost differences and finalize strategy
a.	Decision of cost of each service level can be determined

Analysis of transportation requirements for the customer
-	Driven by demand forecast and demand management activities
-	Consider volume of SKUs first

Equation to determine if adding DC is a net benefit (if top is less than or equal to bottom):

Sum(TL transport + TL processing) 
/ average( # of TLs) +
 average shipment DC cost + average shipment local delivery 

<= 

Processing cost of average shipment + direct freight cost of average shipment

Inventory locations and levels, order size and frequency

-	Average aggregate inventory = order qty/2 + safety stock + in-transit inventory
-	Adding DC locations = 
o	Stock per DC decreases
o	Safety stock will increase
o	Faster in-transit days
o	Reduced cycle time due to distance to customer

Number of warehouses caused by:

Modeling Approaches

Model definition: tool with inputs, processes and outputs

-	Inputs: variables or data
-	Processes: functions performed on the inputs
-	Outputs: business information

Heuristics: form of problem solving in which the results have been determined by experience or intuition instead of optimization.

-	Forecasting
-	Lot sizing
-	Determining production
-	Staff
-	Inventory levels

Cost-volume analysis: compares the fixed + variable costs of locations

Assumptions:

-	Fixed costs are constant
-	Variable costs are at a steady linear rate
-	Only one product is being shipped

Total cost = fixed cost + (variable cost x volume)

Operating leverage: determines at that level break-even is reached

-	High leverage = more fixed costs, but more profits per sale. Break-even is slower to achieve.
-	Low leverage = High proportion of variable costs, but lower profit per sale. Break-even is easier to achieve.

Examples of operating leverage

-	Denver
o	Low fixed costs due to low rent
o	High variable costs due to longer distances
-	Seattle
o	Middle level of fixed and variable costs
-	Los Angeles
o	High fixed costs due to automation
o	Low variable costs due to proximity to customers

 





Cross-over unit examples

Below is a table of various costs

Denver-Seattle example

4,000,000 (Seattle) – 2,000,000 (Denver) / 615/unit(Denver) – 385/unit(seattle) =

2,000,000 / 230 per unit = 8,696 units



City	Fixed Costs	Variable Costs	Maximum Units	Total Cost at Maximum Units
Denver	$2,000,000	$615	26,000	$17,990,000
Seattle	$4,000,000	$385	26,000	$14,010,000
Los Angeles	$8,000,000	$115	26,000	$10,990,000




Crossover Points
Denver–Seattle	8,696	Units
Seattle–Los Angeles	14,815	Units
Denver–Los Angeles	12,000	Units




Interpreting the graph

If forecast < 8,696, Denver
If forecast between 8,696 and 14,815, seattle
If forecast > 14,815, Los angles


 


Weighted Factor Rating Method: places various levels of priority on both quantitative and qualitative factors for a location decision. Usually summed to 100%

Center-of-gravity Method: locating DCs at approximately the location representing the minimum transportation costs between plants, DCs, and markets

-	Coordinate-based (x,y)
-	Based on shipping volume


Formula to calculate the center gravity

-	X: (8*8000) +(16*9000) etc… / 38,000 = 12
-	Y: (10*8000) + (9*8000) etc…. / 38,000 = 8

-	Categorize and prioritize risks
-	Quantitatively analyze risk if desired
-	Pick a basic risk response
o	Accept: take no action
o	Avoid: changing a plan to eliminate risk or protect plan objectives
o	Transfer: have another party assume the risk
o	Mitigate: Reduce exposure to risk in terms of likelihood or impact
-	Develop preventative and contingent action plans
-	Implement action plans
-	Regularly meet to review risk response status

Value at risk (VAR): sum of all of the expected monetary values (EMV). If net sum is positive, then the rewards outweigh the risks. Formula = probability x net monetary impact

International Security measures

Organizations

-	International Chamber of commerce
o	Incoterms
o	Uniform customs and practice for documentary credit
-	World customs organization
o	183 countries
o	Helps clear rapidly low-risk shipments

Business Continuity Planning: plans to ensure that an organization is capable of continuing to deliver products or services at acceptable predefined levels following disruption.

Business continuity management system (BCMS): establishes, implements, operates, monitors, reviews, maintains and improves an organization’s ability of delivering products or services.

ISO 22301: specifies requirements for setting up and managing an effective continuity management system.

Insurance

Ways to insure against loss:

-	Risk transfer to 3rd party (usually insurance company)
-	Self-insurance: requires large amount of money, usually large importers who ship low-value goods and can absorb loss
-	Mixed approach by setting high deductibles

Cargo insurance: dictated by incoterms, carriers have max liability terms

Commercial property insurance: Facility must be damaged or inaccessible

Business interruption insurance: damage is sufficient to shut down all operations, pays salries, relocation expenses and lost new income

Contingent business interruption insurance: Insured customer or supplier losses provide you with reimbursement for lost profits or other transferred risks.

Trade disruption insurance: insurance for trade disruptions not involving physical asset damage. Property, marine and political risk unrelated to your or your supplier’s assets.Addresses nondelivery, project cancellations, government appropriations. Fills in insurance gaps

Global logistics insurance: Customs bonds, bailee (holders of others’ cargo), consolidator liability, foreign port operator insurance, ship hull insurance. Truck liability

Cyber insurance: IT failures and cybercrime

Note that the local DC on the left and on the right is the same DC. (The vehicles return to their local DC at the end of the milk run.) Note also that the organization has created a number of metrics related to overall vehicle efficiency (not included here for brevity), including metrics for excess driver breaks, excess load time, speed loss, quality delays, clients not served, unscheduled vehicle time, scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance time, administrative efficiency, and so on.
Here are some key points regarding the “as is” value stream map:
-	Drivers help load their vehicles, but this reduces available time for driving.
-	Drivers do all of their own unloading at each location.
-	The fill loss is 30 percent, meaning that on average there is 30 percent unused available space in vehicles.
-	On average, drivers finish their routes with 23 minutes remaining, but this is not enough time to reduce the number of vehicles and drivers.
-	Routings provided by corporate do not use dynamic rerouting to deal with traffic issues, but dynamic rerouting software could reduce average route times by 10 percent.


Question 1

How could ADX Wholesale Pharmaceuticals innovate to help implement its parent organization’s strategy to create a reverse supply chain drop zone for customers of online retailers?

Have grocery suppliers deliver to the break-bulk DCs and then include these groceries in local DC deliveries and their milk runs.


Question 2

ADX Wholesale Pharmaceuticals determines that it may be feasible to accept groceries in their current cold chain since they have available warehouse space and the total groceries would occupy about 20 percent of a given vehicle’s cargo space on average. What additional costs would this change create?

It will increase warehouse labor costs and require more time per driver stop.

Question 3

Which is the best way listed to accommodate the larger average amount of time required per driver stop, assuming that all of the options would fix the problem?

Have drivers start their shift with a fully loaded truck and invest in dynamic routing software to reduce the average driving time.

Question 4

On a trial run, a driver did a milk run with pharmaceuticals plus groceries for the subsidiary retail locations. An analyst rode along and timed activities. While the grocery delivery add-on increased average time in a retail store by about 10 minutes, deliveries to non-affiliated doctors and pharmacies make up a significant number of the stops, and these have no grocery deliveries. The average time per stop therefore increased by only five minutes. If the average times to the first retailer, between retailers, and for the return are reduced by 10 percent using dynamic routing software, and the driver starts with a fully loaded truck (which adds 30 minutes to the available time), will this be sufficient to compensate for an extra five minutes per average stop? (Assume that if rounding is needed, planners round toward the more conservative estimate of savings.)


Yes, and it will also improve vehicle utilization metrics.



Question 5

What would be another way to improve vehicle utilization that the organization could add to their “to be” version of the value stream map?

Have the driver drop the groceries off, but get the store employees to place them in the cooler whenever someone is available.

Section: B reverse logistics

Revese logistics: supply chain dedicatd to the reverse flow of products and materials for the purpose of returns, repair, remanufacture, and/or recycling.

-	Manufacturers spend up to 9 to 15% on returns
-	Only 20% have a dedicated logistics strategy to effectively manage returns

Reverse supply chain: planning and controlling of the processes of moving goods from the point of consumption back to the point of origin of repair, reclamation, recycling or disposal.

Supplier > manufacturer > distributor > wholesaler > retailer > end user


Returns: step in the process where a customer sends product back: defective, damaged, out of season, outdated, didn’t meet expectations, or represented excess inventory.

Reasons of returns

-	Customer changing their mind
-	Order entry
-	Recalls: defect or hazard, can be a financial obligation
-	Overstocks: retailer ordered more than what they can sell
-	Obsolete products: nearing the end of their product life cycle
-	Packaging: inconsistent marketing of the product itself

Return policies

-	Zero returns
-	Return rate allowance
-	Discount offers
-	Accept only defective returns
-	Having receivers hold until they have truckload qtys to ensure its economical
-	Gatekeeping: returns only happen after speaking to customer service, reduces level of returns
-	Executive’s guide to reverse logistics (Greve and Davis)
o	Product can be repaired = manufacturer absorbs repair costs
o	Not working properly and under warranty = manufacturer pays costs
o	Not recalled and not working = customer pays repair costs
-	Best practices
o	Retailers deduct charges for returned products and processing and freight costs for shipping returned items from the outstanding payables they have with the manufacturer
o	Manufacturers do not accept or credit in any way product returns from retailers that do not comply with the terms and conditions of ther sales agreements.
o	Defective or recalled products – manufacturer typically pays the freight directly or indirectly
o	Leading manuf. Of high tech products are more strict and do not pay handling or consolidation fees
o	Secondary market buyers pay for their own transportation carrier
o	Product may be shipped using reusable packaging and a return label.






Internal or outsourced reverse logistics?

Internal core competency

-	Provide firm with competitive advantage by making returns easier for customers and by promoting its reputation
-	Firm can monetize some of its efforts by tracking and documenting its income from various methods of handling returns.
-	Increasing demand from customers, shareholders, and governments for products that are recyclable, resuable, and less likely to end up in landfills – viewed as unfriendly.
-	Centralizing returns allows for scale and identify returned product versions correctly


Disposition of Returns


 





6 ways a return can be handled

1.	Return to stock
2.	Return to manufacturer or producer
3.	Liquidate
4.	Donate
5.	Recycle
6.	Dispose

Reverse logistics hierarchy – least to most wasteful

1.	Reduce
2.	Reuse
3.	Recycle
4.	Recover energy during disposal
5.	Dispose in responsible landfill

Remanufacturing: worn-out products are restored to like-new condition. 

Recycling: reintroduction of partial processed product

Repurpose: Take something and use it for something else not originally intended

Recovery: Collection of used and discarded products, components, and materials.

Asset recovery: Cost-effective classification and recovery of usable raw material from product returns, obsolete, or excess goods, scrap and waste.

Donations: many companies do this even if they reach their tax limit

Scrap: material outside of specifications and possessing characteristics that make rework impractical

Salvage: property that, because of its worn, damaged, deteriorated, or incomplete condition or nature, has no prospect of sale or use without major repairs or alterations, but that has some value in excess of its scrap value.

Closed-loop systems: system that accounts for the return flow of products for reuse, asset recovery, or recycling in a way that is cost-effective and maximizes returns.

-	Beer kegs: full of beer when sold and can be returned and refilled for a price
-	Redbox: free-standing movie rental kiosk, reuses discs and cases
-	Printer ink cartridges: when empty, are sent via prepaid mailers back to the company for cleaning, inspection and refilling. 
-	Commercial tire casings sent to a tire retreader who adds new treads


Kodak single-use camera closed-loop supply process:

1.	Supplier sends materials to Kodak
2.	Kodak produces single-use cameras, shipped to retailers
3.	Retailers display the cameras and sell to customers
4.	Customers use the cameras to take photographs and then return them with the film inside to a photo finisher
5.	Photo finisher develops film and creates prints and are sent to the customer
6.	Phot finish sends the used empty cameras in batches to a collection center
7.	Collection center sorts the used cameras, shipped to a subcontractor
8.	Subcontractor cleans and disassembles the cameras, replaces parts as needed and completes final inspection of the cameras, which are shipped to Kodak.
9.	Kodak reloads camera bodies with film and ships cameras to retailers.

Advantages to forward and reverse flow closed loops (example above):

-	Capture a significant portion of the product’s original value
-	Used products are recycled and therefore do not become part of landfills
-	Easier for the manufacturer to balance supply and demand


Optimizing reverse logistics

-	Many firms do not want to deal with product returns
-	Managing reverse logistics
o	Weighing PROs and CONs of establishing its own returns center or using a third party.
o	Senior management must have buy-in to the chosen strategy.
o	High-level finance/IT directors should be involved.
o	Reducing cycle times is crucial
o	Returns should be forecasted
o	Dispositions of returns need to be done consistently

Dekitting: removal of accessories or parts kits from a product and returning either the kit or the main product without the kit to the store. May also refer to the allowance of the resale of kits or products without their parts kits.

Key technologies:

-	The internet
-	Enterprise resources planning
-	Electronic data interchange
-	Internet of things
-	Radio frequency identification
-	Returns management system
-	Reverse payments process
o	20 to 30 inventory turns is a goal for collection center
-	Blockchain: acts as a distributed ledger that can reduce under and over-ordering, parts compatibility

Reverse Logistics costs

-	Activity-based costing: labor, transportation, inventory carrying costs, packaging, transactional, document costs
-	Forward flow analyses and costs plus handling charges: per ton-mile costs + sorting, packaging costs

Adds revenue

-	Returned product liquidation revenue
-	Recycling revenue
-	Repair revenue
-	Restocking charges and warranty/service program fees
-	Increase in sales from warranties, remanufacture programs, environmental reputation, etc
-	Capture tax savings or incentive program benefits

Subtracts revenue

-	Returned product cost of goods sold
-	Inventory carrying costs 
-	Transportation costs 
-	Repair and spare parts costs
-	Warranty expenses and returns credits

Benefits of reverse logistics

-	Customer satisfaction and brand protection
o	Better reputation
-	Tracking and cost recovery
o	Reasons for returns
o	Percentage of cost recovered
o	Energy used in handling returns
o	Product amounts reclaimed and resold
o	Percent of material recycled
o	Amount of waste recycled
-	Other advantages
o	New jobs and roles
o	Decreased use of landfulls
o	Recovery of valuable raw materials
o	Potentially lucrative extended warranties and customer service contracts to manage products at the end of their life cycle

Challenges

-	Forecasting volumes
-	Storage
-	Cost
-	Traceability






Capacity Planning and Demand Management

Forecasting: business function that attempts to predict sales and use of products so they can be purchased or manufactured in appropriate quantities in advance.

Forecasting horizons

-	Long-term: 3+ years, new products, retire others, enter or exit markets, plan facilities and capacity for supply, manufacturing, transportation, warehousing and retail.
-	Medium-term: 1-2 years, budgets, production planning, shorter-term capacity planning (hiring drivers, warehouse employees or negotiating contract extensions).
-	Short-term: less than 1 year, what to purchase or product, logistics services to schedule

Nature of forecasting: consumer demand volatility creates uncertainty within supply chain

Bias: consistent deviation from the mean in one direction (high or low).

Forecasting must create more value than it costs to gather data.

Two principles of forecasting:

-	Aggregate forecasts, such as families or groups of products are more reliable than granular forecasts of individual items
-	Forecasting into the future becomes inherently less reliable.

How to improve forecasting accuracy:

-	Check data sources and data input methods and results for accuracy and reliability.
-	Use demand history than sales history. 
o	Sales history – sales returns + unfulfilled orders + drop ships + estimated loss of sales due to stockouts
-	Use end-consumer demand rather than DC demand
-	Include a margin of error in units or monetary amounts with each forecast to get people used to looking at accuracy.
-	Adhere to organizational targets for forecast quality and acceptable error rates and adjust methods when forecast is missing its targets.
-	Track the accuracy of forecasts before and after expert modifications
-	Keep forecast models as simple as possible.

Bullwhip effect: an extreme change in the supply position upstream, generated by a small change in demand downstream.


Factors affecting demand

-	Trends: general upward or downward movement of a variable overtime
o	Linear
o	Exponential
-	Cycles: shifts in demand lasting longer than one year
-	Seasonality: predictable repetitive pattern of demand measured within a year
-	Random variation: fluctuation in data that is caused by uncertain or random occurrences
o	Common cause: several factors, not modelled due for simplicity’s sake
o	Special cause: assignable
▪	Trends
▪	Seasonality
▪	Causes
-	Promotions: discounts or advertising
o	Promotions explain 50-80% sales variation
-	Minimum quantity requirements: smallest amount of product that can be ordered

Forecasting process:

1.	Determine the purpose of the forecast
2.	Determine level of aggregation and what will be forecasted
a.	Family, product or SKU
3.	Determine the time horizon
4.	Visualize the data
5.	Choose the forecasting method or model
6.	Prepare the data
7.	Test the forecast using historical data
8.	Forecast
9.	Perform sales and operations planning
10.	Periodically review and improve models for accuracy

Qualitative forecasting techniques:

-	Personal insight
-	Sales force estimates
-	Panel consensus
-	Market research
-	Visionary forecasting
-	Delphi method: survey experts



Quantitative forecasting techniques: historical demand data is used to project future demand.

-	Time series: projects historical data patterns into the future
o	Simple moving average
o	Weighted moving average
o	Exponential smoothing
-	Visualizing: able to spot seasonality
-	Deseasonalizing: generating a seasonal index


 


Simple and weighted moving averages, exponential smoothing

-	Simple moving average: average of demand from several preceding periods
-	Weighted moving averages: places weights on periods being averaged, putting emphasis on more recent periods
-	Exponential smoothing: Involves weighting, minimizes lag from trend shift

 
Reseasonalizing: multiplying the deseasonalized data by given periods season index

Associative forecasting (casual, correlation, explanatory, or extrinsic): uses one or more variables that are believed to affect demand in order to forecast future demand.

-	Predictor = independent variable
-	Element being predicted = dependent variable

Simple regression: y = mx + b

Multiple regression: has 1+ predictive variables. EX: marketing spend added to roofing sales analysis.

Distribution channels

-	Supplier > customer
-	Supplier > DC > manufacturer > business 
-	Supplier > DC > manufacturer > DC > customer
-	Supplier > DC > manufacturer > DC > wholesaler > retailer > customer

Production factors

-	Product volume capacity
-	Product mixes
-	Costs of regular vs customized services
-	Delivery times
-	Flexibility of changeovers
-	Agile (scaling up and down)

Production types

-	Make to stock: inventory end units
-	Assemble to order: bill of materials
-	Make to order: raw material

Retail distribution channel

-	Manufacturer’s DC
-	Retailer’s warehouse
-	3PL
-	Wholesaler
-	Direct delivery via owned vehicles, carrier or parcel service
-	Retailer direct pickup
Business-to-business: conducted over internet between companies

-	Commodities: command a higher price when service reliability or faster lead times can be guaranteed
-	Specialized products: changing price, or leas times depending on demand
o	Make to order: reduces inventory
o	Engineer to order: raw material only ordered after design

Supplier to customer

-	Goods do not flow through seller’s warehouse
-	End customer may pay for shipping

Omni-channel distribution

-	Retail location
-	Shop online

Channel selection

-	Reliability / on-time delivery
-	Negotiating minimum order sizes, bulk purchase price breaks, or unit types
-	Packaging for faster or more organized retail store distribution
-	Delivery within narrow windows for cross-docking
-	Minimizing and passing on cast savings in the form of lower prices
-	Adding more value than cost as perceived by end customers
-	Able to quickly communicate service failures, damage reports, and inventory levels

Interpreting forecasts: errors lead to higher costs

Forecast error: difference between actual and forecast demand

Absolute percentage error: A-F/A

Forecast accuracy: 1-forecast error as a percentage

Mean absolute deviation: absolute period errors/# of periods

Mean squared error (MSE): Magnifies errors, makes then positive
	MSE = (sum of errors for each period)^2 / number of periods



Mean absolute percentage error: ratio of errors to the actual demand
	MAPE = (each month absolute value) / 12 (months) *100 = %

Tracking signal: Sum of forecast errors / mean absolute deviatION
-	Companies will set a target value (let’s say 4) so anything beyond that triggers a forecast review

Measuring by SKU

-	Forecast bias
o	if signal is always negative, we are over-forecasting
o	If positive, under-forecasting
-	Suitability of the forecasting method:
o	If it remains in a specified range (4 in this case), method is working correctly

Forecasting exception management

-	Verify logic of forecast
-	Verify data and assumptions, input errors
-	Product groupings
-	Note forecast assumptions separately
-	If forecast is deemed valid, act upon it (decrease or increase capacity)


Logistics demand forecasting starts with sales forecast which will be translated to staffing, equipment, and contracted services

3-to-5 year forecast done for strategic planning will help logistics professionals determine size and number of warehouses.

Annual forecast determines staffing levels and equipment.

Operational weekly forecasting determines warehouse worker scheduling.

Forecasting tools

-	Long-term TL freight volume trends using time series
-	Forecasting rate of returns of a product
-	Weather

o	Product family drives long-term forecast
-	Demand strategy
o	Growth: beginning of life cycle
o	Portfolio: multiple products or services
o	Positioning: postponement, geographic position, agile manufacturing
o	Investment: which channels deserve greater capital investment
-	Demand planning: using forecasting to construct demand estimates (high, low, lumpy, continuous). Aggregated by product family, location, life cycle.
-	Supply planning: detail organizations capabilities and resources required to meet the demand plan
o	Production: aggregate output by product family as a monthly rate. Used to calculate cost of inventory.
o	Resource: equipment, facilities, labor, supplier capacity
o	Inventory: sets period target ending inventory for comparison against actual min/max values
o	Distribution requirements plan specifies logistics resources and warehouse/ transportation capacities needed to move inventory through planned channels
o	Performance metrics and targets: specifying targets enables control
-	Production planning:
o	Chase: increases/decreases production to match seasonal demand, requiring flexible workforce and idle equipment at times
o	Level: produces a steady amount, inventory accumulates during low demand periods.
o	Hybrid: mixes chase and level, outsources near seasonal peaks
o	Production rates
▪	Too low = overheard > profit
▪	High = overtime and quality issues destroy profit
o	Resource planning
▪	Equipment, labor and any other productive capability that adds value through production, storage, or shipping
▪	Bill of resources lists all resources needed to make one unit of the average product in a family

Capacity visualization

 
Demand management process: weighs customer demand and firms output capabilities, tries to balance the two. 

-	Planning demand 
o	Rolling 18-month plan
o	Consensus achieved through the S&OP process 
o	Dashboard information
▪	Historical demand data for past 3+ month
▪	Demand plan for next 18 months
▪	Prior demand plan
▪	Assumptions made
▪	Planned branding, marketing and sales promotions activities
▪	Key risks, opportunities, economic trends, competitor actions
▪	Subtleties and uncertainties
▪	Events and issues of note, decisions that were made

o	 
-	Communicating demand 
o	Demand sensing: collecting data on actual orders
▪	POS
▪	Open orders per period
o	Communicate soon and regularly with a structure
-	Influencing demand:
o	Product management, marketing and sales
o	External balancing: price and adjustments in lead time
▪	Price increases will turn customers to alternatives
▪	Price decreases help with surplus inventory
▪	Bulk purchase discounts
▪	Payment terms
▪	Credit approval policies
▪	Increase lead times: may turn away customers if too long
▪	Positive contribution margin: net profit increases while sales increases. Too much variety can be unsustainable.
-	Managing and prioritizing demand
o	Policy: indicate who is allowed to manage and prioritize demand
▪	Delegating to sales will create conflicts as they are naturally motivated by customers’ best interests
o	Process: Fulfill demand when it is feasible and will increase marginal profits
▪	Fulfilling demand later
▪	Delaying other orders to meet customer’s date
▪	Offering substitute
o	Time frame: change priority only if there is an impact to profitability

Constraint management: (EX) warehouse capacity when a new product line is offered while still working to sell off the old product line

1.	Identify constraint
2.	Exploit constraint: making quick improvements with existing resources
a.	Finding mostly empty bays
b.	Eliminating obsolete inventory
c.	Slower shipping modes for less in-demand items
3.	Subordinating: ensure other processes are arranged 
a.	Picking and outbound shipping is fully staffed
4.	Elevating constraint: add resources
a.	Acquiring more space or more dense storage options
5.	Repeat to find next constraint

Transportation and capacity planning

Macro: water shipping port capacity, air runway and gate capacity, road capacity, road congestion, infrastructure quality. 

Low value items can only be cost effective for small distances via truck.

-	Demand planning
o	Product, brand management, marketing, sales
-	Supply planning
o	Identify capacity or inventory constraints that would limit fulfillment
▪	If demand cannot be met
-	Produce above demand for certain periods to meet spikes in demand later (level strategy)
-	Increase capacity by hiring, adding shifts, planning overtime, leasing new equipment, or outsourcing
-	Reduce the demand plan

Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment: raw materials to end products to customers. Also describes between communication between parties.

Strategy and planning:

-	Collaboration: business goals, scope of collaboration, and assigning roles, responsibilities, checkpoints, and escalation procedures
-	Join business planning: promotions, inventory policy changes, store openings and closings, product introductions.

Demand and supply management:

-	Sales forecasting: manufacturer analyzes market data, retailer forecasts point of sale numbers
-	Order planning/forecasting: manufacturer conducts demand planning, while the retailer undertakes replenishment planning.

Execution:

-	Order-to-cash cycle: placing orders, preparing and delivering shipments, receiving products at the retails site, recording transactions and making payments.
o	Order generation: manufacturer does production and supply planning, retailer conducts buying activities. Logistics will work with either end.
o	Order fulfillment: this involves logistics and distribution management for both manufacturer and retailer

Analysis: identify exceptions, aggregate results, calculate key performance metrics, share insights, and adjust plans.

-	Exception management: monitoring manufacturing and store execution
-	Performance assessment: manufacturer and retailer keep scorecards to assess each other’s performance.

Enterprise partner collaborations

-	Share forecasts and historical data
-	Automate the collaboration arrangement and business plan
-	Evaluate exceptions
-	Enable two-way, real-time conversations, revisions and commentary.

-	Labor

Types of reports:

-	Inventory investment
o	Addresses implications and adequacy of financial resources required by the aggregate channel replenishment plan
o	Projects aggregate inventory costs over a planning horizon, based on product family-level replenishment and shipping costs and inventory balances
-	Transportation planning
o	Addresses transportation requirements necessary to ensure inventory is available at all distribution points
o	Bases costs on unit factors (weight, storage volume, pallets), shipping cost per unit

-	Backlog
-	Availability of material
-	Capacity

Forecast: per-period demand plan for individual item

Customer orders: actual demand

Projected available balance: running sum of on-hand inventory – requirements plus scheduled receipts and planned orders

Available to promise: uncommitted portion of a company’s inventory and planned production maintained in the master schedule to support customer-order promising.

Order promising: making a delivery commitment

Master production schedule: reflects anticipated build schedule. 

Interplant demand: one plant’s need for a part is produced by another plant within the same organization

Time fence: policy to limit changes in operations during a period.

-	Frozen: capacity and materials are committed to specific orders
-	Slushy: there is room to negotiate in the form of tradeoffs. Master scheduler can make those decisions.
-	Liquid: All changes are permissible as long as they don’t violate the limits set in the production plan or by the policy in the sales and operations plan.

Projected available balance = beginning inventory + additional supply – demand

Available to promise (ATP): inventory on-hand + items scheduled to arrive

Material requirements planning: uses bill of material data, inventory and master production to schedule to calculate requirements for materials. 

Dependent demand: directly related to or derived from the bill of material structure for other items of end product. 

Independent demand: Finished foods, parts required for destructive testing, service part requirements

MRP is time-phased:

-	Quantity of all components and materials required to fabricate items

-	Bills of material
-	Planning factors (safety stock concerns and lead times)


Sourcing and procurement

Sourcing: process of identifying a company that provides a needed good or service

Procurement: planning, purchasing, inventory control, traffic, receiving, incoming inspection, and salvage operations

Purchasing strategy

-	Decentralized: more suppliers, fewer economies of scale, ideal for multiple product lines within divisions
-	Hybrid

Spend analysis: balancing consolidation and economies of scale with diversification and minimizing risk.

Make-or-buy decisions: cost of making in-house vs the global market landed cost

Quadrant model:

-	Generics: low risk and low value
-	Commodities: low risk but high value
-	Distinctives: High risk, low value
-	Critical: high risk, high value

Strategic sourcing: focuses on material spend, long-term business partnerships, automated RFQ, RFP, and electronic auctioning, and contract management processes.

Tactical buying: focused on transaction processes. 

Single-source supplier: company with 100% of business to produce a part

Multisourcing: procurement of good from more than one supplier

Sole source: supply is only available at one supplier

-	Firm fixed-price contract: seller is paid a set piece without regard to costs

Incentive contract: where buyer and seller agree to a target cost and maximum price. Cost savings below the target are shared between buyer and seller. If actual exceeds target, cost overrun is shared between buyer and seller.

Incentive arrangements: allows for the sharing of the cost responsibility between the buyer and seller. Incentives are incorporated into the contract to motivate the supplier to improve its performance – target cost, target profit, and the sharing agreement.

Cost-plus-incentive-fee contract: contract in which the seller is paid for costs specified as allowable in the contract plus a profit, provided certain provisions are met.

Fixed-price-incentive-fee contract: contract in which the seller is paid a set price and can earn an additional profit if certain stipulations are met.

CRM – customer relationship management

Lifetime customers:

-	70-80% of customers provide little or not profit
-	40% cost to maintain

Analysis of firm’s customers:

-	Top tier customers
o	Place large or regular orders
o	Easier to deal with
o	Pay on time
-	Middle tier customers
o	Large, but less frequent orders
o	Uncertain or fickle about their desires
-	Low tier customers
o	Small, infrequent orders
o	Do not pay on-time
o	More warranty or claims

Buying experience:

-	Communications
-	Time
-	Dependability
-	Flexibility

80-20 rule: 80% of sales or costs come from 20% of the possible causes

Implementing the CRM process:

1.	Sort customers into profitability tiers
a.	Single allocation criteria: cost of direct materials, labor and overhead for each customer
b.	Activity-based costing: How, how much, what and when a customer order:
i.	Operating profit contribution: gross profit – (invoices x average cost/invoice)
c.	Cost to serve costs of each business activities
2.	Determine service levels
a.	Different product/service packages given to different segments within a tier, providing the best service for higher-profitability customers
b.	Same product/service package offered to everyone with varying quality and service levels by profitability tier
c.	Same product/service package and the same service level can be offered to all customers – easiest to administer, creates higher risk of losing profitable customers
3.	Service level steps
a.	Identify what each profitability tier values
b.	Categorize service components: pre-transaction, transaction, post-transaction
c.	Prioritize elements of customer service by profit tier or segment
d.	Benchmark against competitors to establish relative service level
e.	Perform gap analysis
f.	Design product/service packages that will meet or exceed minimum service
g.	Establish service level metrics, targets and monitoring/controlling procedures
h.	Monitor and control

o	raw materials
o	work-in-process items
-	Support activities 
o	Maintenance
o	Repair
o	Operating supplies
-	Customer service
o	Finished goods
o	Spare parts
Inventory within the supply chain
1.	Suppliers
a.	Raw materials or components 
i.	MRO – maintenance, repair, operating supplies
1.	Chemical supplier’s materials needed for clean up and handling
2.	Oil and spare parts

d.	Postponement parts (awaiting final kitting and shipment)
e.	MRO
4.	Retail outlet
a.	Packaged goods
b.	MRO
Decoupling: separates supply from demand so customer demand can be filled from independent inventories.
Economy of scale: larger volumes of production reduce unit cost
Bullwhip effect
-	Occurs in push / make – to – stock systems
-	Delays in communication from end customer data result in variability and extra inventory on-hand
-	Supply variability also affects this as well
Level of service: percent of orders satisfied by production schedule to satisfy customers’ requested delivery dates and quantities
-	Make to stock calculation variations
o	% of orders picked complete from stock
o	% of line items picked complete
o	% of total dollar demand picked complete
Fill rate: % of time units were shipped on schedule
Stockout: lack of materials, components or finished goods
On-time schedule performance: % of meeting the customer’s originally negotiated delivery date.
Stakeholder perceptions of inventory
-	Inventory shrinkage: reductions in actual quantities of stock due to scrap, theft, deterioration, evaporation (etc)
-	Financial managers want the value of inventory lower (to improve return on assets)
-	Operations managers want higher inventory levels to improve productivity
-	Sales and marketing want to maximize customer service levels and inventory, so objectives are not missed
-	Customers want the right product at the right time, so they want high service levels
Inventory types
-	Operating: what is needed to satisfy forecast demand
-	Excess: will be used within the planning time frame
-	Surplus: Beyond planning time frame and would not have been ordered in the first place
-	Inactive: wasted assets that drags down profitability 
o	Subaru still holds on to “dead” SKUs to ensure high customer service levels




Inventory levels may be too high for the following reasons:
-	Unreliable suppliers
-	Lack of confidence in forecast
-	Demand characteristics that make forecasting difficult
-	Production problems causing delays or rework
Reducing the product cycle time
-	Examine each step to find efficiencies and compress time
-	Reducing inventory lead times and safety stock throughout the pipeline\
o	Order sooner and using JIT repeatedly 
-	Faster transportation options
Functions of inventory
-	Serves demand for raw materials and finished goods
-	Smooths the impact of fluctuations in supply and demand
-	Buffers against uncertainty in supply and demand
-	Creates cost-savings opportunities through enabling economies of scale or various hedging tactics
Lot size: amount of a particular item that is ordered from the plant or a supplier
Cycle stock: depletes gradually as customer orders are fulfilled
Pipeline stock: inventory in-progress and in-transit to DC. Has impact on:
-	Order transmission
-	Order processing
-	Scheduling
-	Shipping
-	Transportation
-	Receiving
-	Stocking
-	Review time
Anticipation inventories: additional inventory above basic pipeline stock to cover demand
Issues with aligning supply and demand
-	Geographical specialization 
-	Decoupling supply and demand
-	Seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand



Inventory threats
-	Forecast may not have considered the impact of improved economic conditions, thus understating demand
-	Shipments may be delayed in transit due to weather, traffic, carrier issues, or other causes.
-	Product defect may require replacement and may draw inventory down unexpectedly.
Safety stock: planned to be inventory to protect against fluctuations in demand or supply
Hedge inventory: inventory build up for unplanned speculations like riots or strikes
Economies of scale within supply chain:
-	Procurement – when suppliers offer volume discounts
-	Production – when runs are longer
-	Transportation – larger order = higher economical tier
Inventory costs
-	Acquisition
o	Unit 
▪	Material

Order cancellation effects:
1.	Erosion of the customer relationship
2.	Reputation suffers
3.	End customer finds alternatives, thus ending future orders
Module 6 Section B: Inventory Control, Strategy, and Policy
Types of demand:
-	Independent: determined by forecasting, safety stocks usually required
-	Dependent: requirement for independent demand inventory
o	Vertical: SKU required for the production of another SKU
o	Horizontal: combined to form one SKU (kitting)
-	Dual: Same parts used to manufacture (dependent) and in repair (independent)
Fixed order quantity system: triggers re-ordering at a point 
Order point: set inventory level where, if the total stock on hand plus on order falls below that point, action is taken to replenish the stock. 
Order point = anticipated demand x lead time
-	EX: Mobile phones
o	Demand = 200 / day
o	Lead time = 3 days
o	Order point = 200 * 300 = 600
Lot-for-lot: generates planned orders in quantities equal to the net requirements in each period
Point of sale: relief of inventory and computation of sales data at the time and place of sales through bar coding or magnetic media and equipment
Master production schedule provides the time-phased information required to know how much to reorder

Economic order quantity: type of fixed order quantity model that determines the amount of an item to be purchased or manufactured at one time
EOQ = Square root ( (2 * Annual usage in units *Order costs) / (annual carrying cost % * unit cost))
Exceptions to EOQ
-	Quantity discounts: unit cost decreases as the lot size increases, carrying costs mya increase as well
-	Joint replenishment: coordinating the lot sizing and order release decision for related items
-	Transportation costs
Before using EOQ:
-	Qualitative judgment must be done after calculating EOQ
-	EOQ is indicative, but not precise
-	More demand variability = less validity of EOQ

Min-max system: 
-	Min = order point (minimum amount to demand during replenishment lead time)
-	Max = order up to point (max safety stock buffer)
-	Recommended when sum of available and on-order inventory is at or below the min
-	Not used for external suppliers, only internal DC transfers

Cycle service level: the probability of not having a stockout in one ordering cycle
Vendor managed inventory: businesses share inventory management responsibilities with their suppliers
-	Covered products defined
-	Order points and order quantities defined
-	What data is shared
Consigned stocks: inventories that are in the possession of customers, dealers, agents and brokers, but remain the property of the manufacturer by agreement

Certificate of manufacture: attests that the goods were manufactured in the exporter’s country, signed by exporter’s chamber of commerce

Certificate of inspection: provided by an independent organization attesting to the accuracy of the value of the goods listed on the invoice

Certificate of free sale: attests that the goods can be legally sold in the country of export, intent is to prevent defective products from being exported

Import license: importing country’s government document that provides an importer with the express authorization to import a particular product

Certificate of insurance: required under some terms of trade and attests that a particular shipment has insurance coverage

Carnet: temporary admission for passing through a country rather than being imported into it

Export Documentation

Shipper’s export declaration (SED): export/import document prepared by the shipper before the shipment can be exported and presented to a government authority of the country. Specifies value, weight, destination

EEI (the export declaration) was introduced in 2014 to streamline processes

Declaration for free entry of returned products: if good has value added prior to its return, duty may be due on either the fair market value of the labor that was added or the item itself

Export license: document received from a governmental agency authorizing a certain quantity of an export to be sent to a given country.

International Transportation Documents

US Export Administration Regulations requires a “Destination control statement” be included on the invoice, bill of lading, air waybill or other export control document

International bill of lading: bill of lading used in international trade to help ensure exports are paid and imports receive the promised goods

-	Acts as a contract between the shipper and the transportation carrier to transport and deliver goods
-	Signature of the carrier is the shipper’s proof that the carrier received the goods
-	Signature of the consignee at delivery serves as a receipt for the goods
-	B/L is the basis for filing freight claims

Ocean bill of lading: contract between an ocean carrier and a shipper arranging for carriage of freight. Shipper is responsible for all losses other than negligence on the part of the ocean carrier

Through bill of lading (intermodal): allows a carrier to transport goods both domestically and across international borders. Issued when a single shipment travels to its destination by more than one mode of transport or by more than one truck, railcar, ship, or aircraft

Uniform bill of lading: products are being transported on trucks and trains, domestically and internationally. Considered non-negotiable like straight BOLs


Two forms of B/Ls related to the quality of the goods shipped can be issued by the receiver after a thorough inspection:

-	Clean bill of lading, which indicates goods were in good condition
-	Claused (soiled or foul) bill of lading, which indicates that the products transported were damaged in some manner

Waybills

-	Air Waybill (AWB): bill of lading for transporting domestic or international freight by air
-	Road waybill (standard truckload BOL)
-	Rail waybill

Packing list: list showing merchandise packed, a copy of which is sent to the consignee to help verify the shipment

Customs clearance process in the US

1.	Importer files entry that lets customs now that it will or has imported specific product
a.	Key documents should be filed 7 to 10 days prior to physical arrival of shipment
i.	CBP entry summary
ii.	Commercial / pro forma invoice
iii.	Shipping forms
iv.	Packing lists
v.	Other required documents
b.	Evidence of bond posting with customs must occur
2.	Customs is notified of shipment arriving at an international point of entry
a.	Carriers apply for release for release of goods upon arrival
i.	Road border crossing
ii.	Airport
iii.	Seaport
iv.	Train terminal
3.	Customs may examine shipment once it has reviewed entry documents
a.	Verification may include:
i.	Value
ii.	Duty status
iii.	Proper labeling
iv.	Country of origin
v.	Check for prohibited articles
vi.	Goods match invoice
b.	If there are problems, load can be held until corrected, exported or destroyed
4.	Customs determines classification and corresponding duties owned on goods based on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. When the duty is paid, shipment is “liquidated”
5.	Customs releases goods to importer, who coordinates the last leg of the journey
a.	If importer wants to postpone duty payment, goods may be stored in customs bonded warehouse for up to 5 years or brought to FTZ

Customs brokers:licensed firms or individuals by customs that facilitate clearance

Duty: tax levied by a government on the importation, exportation, or use and consumption of goods. Based on:
-	Type of goods being imported, classified according to the harmonized system of classification
-	Value of goods imported, based on invoice
-	Value of any “duty assist” given by the importer to the manufacturer (importer provides the tooling needed to produce the product)
-	The country from which the products are imported

Harmonized system classification codes: internationally standardized description of goods that uses a system of numbers to provide increasingly detailed classifications and descriptions
-	98% of world trade recognizes this system
-	Up to 10 digits
-	First 6 - root
-	Last 4 - country specific subcategories

Harmonized Tariff Schedule: US International Trade Commission’s mechanism by which international tariffs are standardized. Importers and exporters classify goods moved across international borders.

Valuation: goods being shipped determines a variety of other charges and tariffs. 
-	Landed value: 
-	Cost of packaging
-	Transportation in the exporting country
-	International transportation to the destination
-	International insurance
-	US uses the FCA / FAs method
-	Packaging
-	Transportation








Taxes: most countries used value-added tax (VAT) or goods and services tax (GSC)

Finance and payment options

*Incoterms® 2010 recommend explicitly stating who will pay for the insurance in a contract or quote. Incoterms® trade terms indicate where risk/liability is transferred but do not actually obligate the buyer or seller to carry insurance except when explicitly noted in the term. In most cases, companies will maintain cargo insurance as a backup.


Incoterms definitions (all modes):
-	Ex Works (EWX): buyer pays all transportation costs and bears all risks for transporting the goods to their destination
-	Free Carrier (FCA): seller delivers goods into the carrier’s custody. Risk passes from seller to buyer. Buyer pays for transportation from the place named in incoterm. Seller is responsible for correcting and paying for any problems or costs of clearing customs
-	Carriage Paid To (CPT): seller pays for the freight to the named point of destination. The passing of risk occurs when the goods have been delivered into the custody of the first carrier
-	Carriage and insurance paid to (CIP): passing of risk occurs when the goods have been delivered into the custody of the first carrier. From this point, buyer bears all risk and any additional costs. Seller pays for insurance and is required to clear the goods for export
-	Delivered at Terminal (DAT): seller delivers the goods at a named terminal or destination. If possible, both parties should try to agree at which point risk is transferred. 
-	Delivered at Place (DAP): Seller delivers the goods to the buyer, who assumes responsibility for their unloading at a named destination.
-	Delivered Duty Paid (DDP): seller pays for all transportation costs, bears all risk until goods have been delivered, and pays for the duty

Incoterms for sea and inland waterway transport:
-	Free Alongside Ship (FAS): seller pays for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment. Buyer pays loading costs, freight, insurance, unloading costs, and transportation to the port of destination. Risk is passed once goods are delivered to pier at the port of shipment
-	Free on Board (FOB): only used for ocean shipping. Better for bulk, break-bulk cargo, or roll on roll off cargo. Responsibility shifts when freight is on vessel. Exporters pay for packaging, shipping to the port of departure, stevedore loading costs, customs clearing, and exporting country pre-shipment inspection. Importer pays for ocean carrier costs, inbound customs costs.
-	Cost of Freight (CFR): seller pays for costs and freight of the goods to the destination port. Buyer pays for the insurance and transportation from the port of discharge (POD). Risk of loss shifts when the goods are on board at the port of shipment. CFR is not used for air or land transport. 
-	Cost, insurance and Freight (CIF): selling price includes the cost of the goods, freight or transport costs, and marine insurance. Under CIF, seller must obtain in transferable for a marine insurance policy to cover the risks of transit. Seller’s responsibility ends when the goods have been delivered on board the shipping vessel at the port of shipment. If seller wants to end responsibility to end when goods are delivered into the hands of a carrier prior to the goods passing the ship’s rail.

Methods of Payment

Cash in advance: payment by the importer to the exporter before the exporter ships the goods, providing the maximum protection to the exporter and no protection to the importer.

Letters of credit: formal letter in which a bank assures the seller that the buyer is good for the purchase price of the foods and that the bank will therefore honor the buyer’s checks to the seller up to that amount.
-	Revocable: pro forma document used to prepare an irrevocable letter of credit
-	Irrevocable: type cannot be canceled by the issues bank unless the exporter agrees to that decision
-	Confirmed irrevocable: foreign bank provides the letter of credit. Guaranteed by a bank in the exporter’s country and is therefore more expensive

Letter of Credit process:
1.	L/C issued. After agreeing to the terms of sale, the buyer/importer goes to its bank and gets a letter of credit demonstrating that the bank has faith in the buyer’s/importer’s ability to pay the purchase price
2.	Buyer’s bank notifies the seller’s bank that the L/C has been issued. Assures the seller’s bank that it can honor drafts from the seller up to the amount of the purchase price. Locks in currency rate.
3.	Seller ships the cargo.
4.	Seller asks its banker for money
5.	Seller’s bank asks buyer’s banker for money
6.	Buyer’s bank waits for cargo (perhaps)
7.	Everyone gets paid

Bill of exchange payment: promissory note that the importer uses to formally acknowledge its debt to the exporter
-	Types of drafts
-	Date: 30, 60, 90 days after date of shipment
-	Time: 30, 60, 90 days after importer signs the draft
-	Sight: seller retains title of the goods until the goods until the importer makes the payment and then receive the bill of lading or air waybill
Open Account (high risk to seller)

Open account payment: method of payment for goods shipped in advance of payment, in which the buyer or importer sends the seller or exporter an invoice requesting payment by a certain date

Exporter sends an invoice to the importer once the products have shipped:

-	Payment due dates
-	Number of days at which importer will be considered past due
-	Interest rate charges on late payments
-	Discounts for early payment(s)
-	Cost of risk insurance

Currency and Tax Considerations

Three options for currency:
-	Convertibility: ease at which one currency can be converted into another.
-	Risk of fluctuation

Reducing transaction explode through hedging

-	Forward market hedge: exporter would purchase the necessary currency to over the foreign payable based on difference in the exchange rates of the two countries
-	Money market hedging: firm protecting its exposure (exporter/seller) will borrow money from a bank in the importer’s country that is an amount equal to the present value of the pay for goods sold.

Transfer pricing: selling a product to another division of the company, usually at market rate “arm’s-length customer” which is straight-forward
-	Selling intracompany goods to subsidiary in lower-tax country is highly regulated, known as base erosion and profit shifting
-	Companies often sell to free trade zones


Foreign/free trade zone (FTZ): designated area within a country that is outside the country. Material is not subject to duties and taxes until material is moved out. 
-	Encourages exports
-	Useful if rates on tariffs are higher than the rates on final products
-	Re-exported materials owe no duties
-	Customs duties and federal excise taxes on imports are deferred
-	Foreign and domestic goods that are to be exported are exempt from state and local inventory taxes
-	Merchandise can be held at the FTZ indefinitely 
-	Goods can be inspected and tested before paying import duties
Companies that have FTZs: Caterpillar, BMW, Ryder Group, GE, Kawasaki Motors













 
 





	















































































































































































Module 1: Logistics Overview and Strategy


Section A Definitions

Order-to-delivery cycle: period of time when customer places an order and when customer receives the order

Logistics = Materials management + Distribution 

Inbound logistics functions: demand forecasting, purchasing, production planning, manufacturing inventory, raw materials and subassembly warehousing, materials handling.

Outbound logistics: finished goods/DC warehousing, finished goods inventory, materials handling, industrial packaging, distribution requirements planning, order processing, transportation, customer management

Systems concept emphasizes whole system vs individual parts

Total cost concept: all decision should favor a total reduction in cost, not just individual parts

Logistics costs: local delivery, primary transport, DC storage costs, inventory carrying, information system costs

Line haul: terminal to terminal

DC storage costs: economies of scale achieved with larger DCs

Inventory carrying costs: capital (physical inventory + financing + opportunity cost), storage (space + personnel + equipment), risk (insurance, pilferage, inventory deterioration, damage, obsolescence) 

Make-to-order: goods made after order receipt

Make-to-stock: products finished before receipt, production orders replenish stock

Assemble-to-order: assembled after order receipt, useful when there are common components

Suboptimization: Too narrow of a solution

Warehouse tradeoffs: #, how much inventory, full or selected assortments, size, layout and location relative to suppliers and customers

Inventory management: who controls re-ordering, how to reorder, verify accuracy of inventory levels

Import/export: customs expertise, local vs outsourced

Packaging: reusable or sustainable

Demand forecasting: early = less accurate, later = more accurate, less time to action

Purchasing: supplier distance, order size affects mode

Production planning: type of order (make to stock, etc)

Materials: efficient order picking must be considered, flow of warehouse

Order management: speeding up process can lower transportation costs

Logistics information systems: more information = less inventory

Customer management: balancing service levels and expectations, short lead times = more variability and cost

Four P’s: Product, price, place, promotion 

Product: size, weight, density, dimensions, packaging, displays

Price: too high = less sales, too low = less profit margins

Place: distribution channels, where to meet demand

Promotion: push = orderly demand from wholesalers, pull = less predictable (DTC)

Echelon: supply chain node (retailer, DC, supplier, etc)

SKU: stock keeping unit





Time utility: deliver not too early or late

Place utility: desired customer location

Possession utility: advertising SKUs and promoting desirability

Form utility: changing form of good through production process (break-bulking and mixing)

Quantity utility: right qty delivered, error free, matches demand

Information utility: ability of customer to communicate requirements

Service utility: customer receives right post-sale support via desired communication channel

Network design: responsive, agile, least amount of inventory, nearness to suppliers and customers, types of distribution channels

Inventory: maximize turnover (velocity)

Order processing: correct information, resolution of payment issues

Transportation: cost vs service level, type of carrier, minimum service levels

Warehousing, materials handling, packaging: manages equipment, labor and space

Drivers of logistics: cost vs customer service, needs, schedule compression, globalization, market trends, competition, complexity/risk, technology, triple bottom line, regulations/compliance, extreme weather and network failure

Home delivery implications: showcasing (shopping between retailers), night time deliveries decrease vehicle utilization, increased demand for parcel services, order picking has increased time and cost, high return % for online orders, grocery deliveries require temp control

Schedule compression: shortened product life cycles, increased focus to minimize inventory

Globalization: sourcing local vs international affects execution and costs





Market trends: 

-	towards omni-channel distribution models
-	mergers/acquisitions increased to spread fixed costs over more units
-	3PLs and economies of scale
-	growth in power of retailers over manufacturers
-	retailer power over logistics providers

Competition: emerging markets are followed by other companies

Complexity and risk:

-	Proliferation of SKUs
-	Regulatory or safety requirements that call for changes in materials handling, storage, or transportation processes
-	Process improvements or added duties, such as final assembly for postponement
-	Outsourcing to foreign countries with different cultures
-	Separate logistics systems for direct deliveries, retail, and reverse logistics
-	For global logistics, longer lead times, higher variability, and more transportation modes and intermodal transportation

Technology: 

-	Documentation 
-	blockchain - tracing each step of supply chain
-	AI - improving decision systems like demand management
-	Digital freight matching apps - automate tendering and shopping

The Triple Bottom Line: profitability, social and economic

Regulations: hazardous equipment, driver hours, tariffs

Extreme weather/network failure: contingency plans needed

Section B Definitions: The Role, Value and Cost of Logistics

Supply chain management = suppliers + logistics + customers

Stages of maturity

1.	Baseline: internal silos hinder integration, inventory buffers, handoffs, external relationships are transactional, logistics seen as cost center with poor cost control
2.	Functional integration: internal processes are integrated, buffer inventories still exist. Improvements and decisions are seperate.
3.	Internal Integration: logistics is integrated, elimites buffer inventories except for raw materials and finished goods.
4.	External integration: inventory is minimized with information, demand generation and fulfillment are integrated


Channel master: partner with the most power in relationships that creates trends

Comparative advantage: country A can produce more units than country B

Economic impact of logistics: countries that invest in infrastructure see lower transportation costs as % of GDP

Landed cost: product + warehousing + transportation + handling fees. Sourcing closer to demand can assist with lowering it. 

Law of squares (Lardner’s law): any reduction in transportation cost will be directly proportional to the increase in the market area where product can be sold competitively. EX: cutting costs in half, doubles the radius you can serve. 

Increase inventory turnover = increase economic value of logistics

Average inventory = units sold /  cycle time + safety stock. EX: 100/units per day, 10 day cycle time = 1,000 units. Divide by 2 = 500 average inventory. If cycle time is reduced from 10 to 5, 500 units / 2 = 250 average inventory.

Reducing cycle time from 104 to 61 days would save $30 billion in the grocery industry.

Impacts of globalization:

-	Higher customer expectations - ecommerce
-	Exports of finished goods vs subassembly components increasing
-	Larger containerships
-	Countries now have low cost, highly skilled labor
-	Reduced trade barriers
-	EU’s deregulation increases transit times
-	3PL technology improving

Challenges:

-	Tariffs/regulations of different countries lead to more time/expertise/costs
-	Cultural differences hinder trade agreements
-	Bribery
-	Terrorism
-	Infrastructure poor in some areas

E-commerce: increased D2C sales via internet, increased final mile carrier capacity, 3PLs under pressure = less logistics players in market
Topic 2: The Value of Logistics Management

Logistics manager duties

-	Clearly explaining desired end result
-	Trusting person to do the work independently
-	Challenge status quo

Leadership

-	Trait model - charisma, passion and decisiveness. Drawback is that the candidate may be less technical.
-	Process-based model - recognizing issues/problems, assemble right team, supporting collaboration, and gathering feedback. May not challenge status quo

Logistics competitive advantages 

-	reduce cost of transportation, labor and inventory
-	improve customer service levels while maintaining profitability
-	It’s cohesive bond between sales, procurement and production

How to create a competitive advantage:

-	Efficiency - lowest cost provider of logistics to compete on price through high asset utilization, high inventory turnover, minimal inventory. Automated workflows exist too
-	Agility - able to scale based on demand signals
-	Resilience - withstand disruptions through diversification
-	Customer focus - aims to have best in class service levels: perfect order fulfillment, satisfaction, post-sale support
-	Responsiveness
-	Quality
-	Experience
-	Complexity competence - import/export terms

Promoting efficiency: level production despite demand peaks. Can be accommodated by:
-	Extra warehousing capacity
-	Produce goods in peak demand in opposite season
-	Produce goods with steady demand year round
-	Contract warehousing to flex capacity
-	Rent warehouse space to organization with opposite demand profile


Reducing costs

-	Reducing costs creates more leverage than increasing revenues
-	EX: $10 item
-	$6/unit (variable)
-	$300,000 (fixed)
-	Selling 100,000 units = $1,000,000 revenue - $600,000 variable costs - $300,000 fixed = $100,000 profit
-	10% increase in sales (110,000 units) = $1,100,000 revenue and $660,000 variable costs - $300,000 fixed = $140,000 profit
-	Reduction of 10% in variable cost = 100,000 units, $1,000,000 revenue, $540,000 variable costs, $300,000 fixed = $160,000 profit (60% increase
-	Factors
-	Supplier locations
-	Inventory locations relative to demand
-	Transportation bids
-	Human resources
-	Information systems 
-	Inventory carrying cost
-	Turnover

Increasing Customer Satisfaction and Service Levels

-	Continuous improvement 
-	Adjust logistics cost and service to customer

Topic 3: Logistics Costing

Traditional accounting obscures the impact of inventory and  transportation - two largest sources of logistics costs

Inbound = included in COGS

Outbound = operating expense, not included in gross profit figure, shipment pricing can be bundled together, which obscures expenses

Fixed cost = Expenditure that does not vary with production volume: rent, property tax, salaries

Variable cost = changes directly with one unit of production
-	Direct cost = variable costs associated with job or operation 

Indirect cost = costs not directly incurred by an operation, such as plant heating

Direct material = material that becomes part of final product in measurable quantities 

Direct labor = Labor applied to good being manufactured or used in the performance of a service

Contribution margin = sales revenue - variable costs

Contribution = sales price - variable costs

Variable cost of goods sold = direct materials, direct labor, supplies

Variable direct cost
-	Discounts and promotions
-	Sales bonuses and commissions
-	Variable customer management costs
-	Other volume-based selling and admin expenses

Variable gross profit - variable direct cost = contribution margin

Opportunity cost = return on capital that could have resulted if capital had been used somewhere else

Net profit approach = determines net profit of each element (does not effectively measure logistics costs)
-	Example: 

Activity based costing = costs driven by activities that consume resources

Direct costs = in ABC, a cost that can be tracked, like units produced, production line, department or manufacturing plant 

Tracing = connecting resources to activities to cost objects

Cost object = anything for which a separate cost measurement is desirable. Product, customer, project, or other work unit

Driver = operation that influences the quality of work and cost




Examples of drivers:

-	Warehousing - pallet bays used, hours consumed
-	Palletized: qty of cartons
-	Put-away: cubic volume
-	Order picking: qtys, number of visits to pick location, number of lines
-	Supervision: supervisor hours
-	Transportation: number of deliveries and distance traveled

How to determine cost rates:	

-	Classify activities
-	Estimate cost of each activity
-	Determine unit rate per pick (salary of pickers / units picked)

Throughput accounting = because every system has a constraint that limits global performance, impact can be measured in context of global measures
-	Used to expense logistics equipment


Theory of constraints accounting = throughput, inventory and operating expense

Net profit = (sales revenue - true variable costs) - operating expenses

-	Net profit = throughput - operating expenses


Section B Quiz

Question 1

How did shift from logistics to supply chain affect how inventory is perceived? Shifted towards it becoming a strategic decoupling point - improve information flow, match demand

Question 2

What role was added on to logistics as supply chain management evolved? Externally integrated information systems


Question 3

What is the disadvantage of local deliveries + local production (high costs) vs sourcing in a low labor region?

Competitors will have a cost advantage globally

Question 4

Activity based costing

Type A - $.30 per pick, 5000 units
Type B - $.40 per pick, 3000 units
Type C - $.50 per pick, 1000 units

What percent of costs is in type C?

5000*.30 + 3000*.40 + 1000 *.5 =  3200

Type C (500) / 3200 = .15625 =  15.6%



Question 5

What is a leading indicator of a low-labor country not remaining? Economic success on a macro level

Question 6

What is a market pressure on 3PLs that move TL and LTL? Direct to consumer trends threaten model
	
Question 7

If an organization wants to be customer focused, what should it do?

Be different things for different customers




Question 8

Company is deciding whether or not to invest in a new fleet. If operating at full capacity, revenue would increase from 200,000 to 300,000 per month. If drivers need to make fewer runs and will idle 10% of the time, what amount of revenue should be used for calculation?

300,000 * .10 = 30,000
300,000 - 30,000 = $270,000

Question 9

Why are traditional accounting methods less useful for logistics costing?

Insurance costs for inventory are grouped with other types of insurance.

Question 10

Why use activity based costing? (per unit measured)

Fairer way to distribute costs among customers

Question 11

What is a good option if high fuel costs are making a products landed cost higher than the price consumers are willing to pay?

Move operations to a location closer to demand

Question 12

What needs to be leverage in order to gain true benefits of supply chain management?

Logistical networks of customers and suppliers - prevents duplicating efforts





Question 13

What is a primary factor that can result in higher logistics costs as a percentage of gross domestic product?

Aggregate inventory levels


Question 14

What is a factor that would require having higher levels of customer service in logistics vs other industries?

Highly substitutable goods - backorders lead to lost sales in competitive environment

Question 15

What is a key leadership skill that can be learned?

Ability to admit mistakes

Question 16

How would a company that uses near sourcing to reduce logistics costs could break into distance markets?

Near-source separately in each key market

Question 17

What receives stronger emphasis in supply chain management than in logistics?

Strategic planning

Question 18

What action by a logistics manager would empower his or her employees?

Have employees participate in setting performance targets



Question 19

If transportation labor costs would be volatile, how can an organization reduce risk of landed cost being too high?

Source closer to the point of demand




Question 20

What is the most effective way to increase an organization’s profits?

Reduce transportation costs by 10%

Question 21

What is a good way to increase the profitable service area for a DC?

Decrease transportation costs to the DC

Question 22

Company A - contribution margin: $500,000, fixed costs: $150,000 
Company B - contribution margin: $300,000, fixed costs: $80,000, indirect costs: $200,000

If customer B was dropped, what would be change to net profit?

Company A contribution margin: $500,000 - $150,000 = $350,000
Company B contribution margin: $300,00 - $80,000 = $220,000
$350,000 + $220,000 = $570,000 - fixed indirect costs of $200,00 = $370,000

Customer B $350,000 - fixed indirect costs of $200,000 = $150,000. $370,000 - $150,000 = $220,000 drop in profits.

Need to know net profit.


Question 23

Warehouse at $200,000 in fixed costs. $10/unit in variable costs. Half of the costs direct/indirect. 5,000 pallets in storage, what is cost per pallet?

$20,000 / 5,000 pallets = $40 per pallet + $10 per pallet = $50 per pallet

Logistics strategies
-	Generic
-	Cost leadership
-	Differentiation
-	Focus
-	Customer service
-	Group by segment
-	Bowersox / Daughtery
-	Process - reduce cost through lean
-	Market - reduce complexity
-	Information - share info to increase cohesion and external partner collaboration

Example goals to increase return on capital:
-	Order-to-delivery cycle of 10 days or less
-	Fulfillment lead time of 3 days or less
-	Inventory days of supply of 15 days of less

Objectives
-	Network integration - information that drives inventory strategy, transportation service requirements, network design, # of DCs, automation
-	Inventory 
-	Levels - nonproductive inventory
-	Turnover 
-	Transportation - mode selection to minimize cost, short local deliveries, effective use of 3PLs
-	Variance reduction - provides shorter order cycle time, lower safety stock
-	Agility - how to scale capacity
-	Product life cycle support / reverse logistics - introduction, growth, maturity, decline, returns, recalls and recycling. Returns are a huge drain on profit
-	Quality - Damage, incorrect deliveriest
-	Customer service and responsiveness

Topic 3: cost and service optimization

-	Availability
-	Operational performance
-	Service reliability

Innovative thinking

-	Shipment consolidators
-	Delaying shipments to consolidate orders (accepting long lead times and higher inventory)
-	Partnerships with others with same origin-destination pairings
-	Long-term contracts with package services to control cost 

Dwell: duration of time between cargo arrives in a terminal’s in-transit storage and when it is shipped by clearance transportation




Systems Perspective

-	Represented as a diagram:
o	Airport
o	Seaport
o	Warehouse
o	Market
o	Plant
-	Links connect nodes


Total cost of ownership: sum of all costs associated with every activity of the supply stream: 

-	Purchase cost – price per unit from suppliers
-	Production cost – cost per unit of direct materials, direct labor, and factory overheard
-	Landed cost - product + warehousing + transportation + handling fees
-	Monitoring/control costs

Items typically omitted from TCO:

-	Financing and opportunity costs
-	Sales and marketing
-	Administrative
-	Reverse logistics
-	Insurance and risk management
-	Taxes / foreign exchange

Post-transaction costs (might be included in TCO):

-	Requirements for research
-	Product development
-	Contract sourcing
-	Plant opening/closings
-	Hiring/layoffs
-	Supplier education
-	System integration






Ongoing costs of TCO

-	Life cycle – quality, durability, maintainability vs price
-	Costs of quality – defects, repairs, rework, returns, warranties
-	Sustainability costs – recycling, recovery of materials
-	Customer service and reputation costs (support, lost customers)

Total cost minimization

-	Simplified model - # of DC points and transportation costs
-	Companies often ignore effects of long lead times and associated carrying costs
o	EX: Sourcing copper in Brazil, South Korea, China and US is cheapest in China, but the short lead times in US had the lowest costs.

Make or buy cost analysis: deciding to produce an item internally or buy from outside supplier. Factors: costs, capacity, proprietary, knowledge, quality considerations, skill requirements, volume, and timing. 

Outsourcing: process of having suppliers provide goods and services that were previously provided internally.

Insourcing: using firm’s resources to provide goods or services

Subcontracting: sending production work outside to another manufacturer

Make-or-buy considerations:

-	Core competency?
-	Consequences of lost skills and knowledge?
-	Landed cost or TCO?
-	What is the break-even point?

Core competency: skills or knowledge sets that provide greatest level to its customers that is difficult to outsource or subcontract out

Consequences of lost skills and knowledge: many companies insource many functions because outsourcing is risky due to less control of customer experience. 





Landed cost or TCO, factors to consider:

-	Control – quality, processes, sustainability
-	Customer focus and responsiveness
-	Risk management – risk of IP theft, litigation, damage to reputation

Offshore outsourcing case study (TCO): 70% reduction in labor costs, increased transportation costs of 20%, increased monitoring and control costs of 20$ = net reduction in costs of 30%

TCO factors favoring a buy decision:

-	Agility – respond to demand
-	Resilience
-	Reduced capital expenditures
-	Better focus on core competencies
-	New ideas
-	Access to new markets
-	Expertise and complexity management

Break-even analysis: study of number of units or time to recoup an investment

-	EX: 
o	Plant costs $10 million, Variable cost = $25/unit
o	Buy from vendor = $0 fixed costs, $35 in variable costs
o	$35-25 = $10/unit
o	$10,000,000 / $10/unit = 1,000,000 units to break even
-	If demand > 1,000,000 = make
-	If demand < 1,000,000 = buy 

Topic 4: contracting and budgeting

Steps in contracting process
1.	Begin with goal in mind and document plans
2.	Analyze strategic imperatives – core competencies
3.	Analyze costs of current state
4.	Select providers
a.	Define requirements
b.	Identify type
c.	Locate and research potential providers
d.	Request RFP
e.	Evaluate and compare responses
f.	Select a contractor and negotiate
g.	Finalize contract
5.	Implement contract
6.	Reorganize internal process and transition staff
7.	Manage contract relationships
a.	Develop strategic, tactical and operational goals
b.	Feedback channels
c.	Measure performance in both directions
d.	Improve service through continuous improvement

Budgeting methods

-	Static – based on expected demand and capacity level
-	Flexible budget (expense) – dynamically adjusts to changes in sales and demand for logistics services
-	Rolling budget – Budget that is revised every 12 to 18 months

Important budgets for logistics

-	Capital – determines long-term funding for projects (build property, plant, software)
-	Logistics operating budget – determines necessary expenditures to deliver service level.
-	Cash budget – control timing of cash flows

Budgeting process:

1.	Set objectives and policies
2.	Analyze capacity and resources in a gap analysis
3.	Update and clearly communicate parameters
4.	Coordinate and review sub budget development
5.	Get final budget approval
6.	Distribute and communicate the importance of the budget

Setting goals – minimum, expected, or likely and stretch (motivates continuous improvement)

Cash budget:

-	Cash receipts (actual inflows)
-	Cash disbursements (outflows)
-	Cash surplus or deficit
-	Financing – borrowings or repayments to cover deficits

Customer segmentation

-	Least profitable business sectors = minimum level of service
-	Delivery channel 
-	Product – mode of transportation, warehousing
o	Bulk materials – liquids, grains
o	Size and shape – pallet or floor loaded
o	Temperature – type of truck
o	Value – insurance, mode, risk
o	Variety – risk of high inventory
o	Hazardous goods – compliance, insurance
o	Cross-contamination – segregate chemicals, etc

Product life cycles

1.	Development – research, design, testing, finalization, specs (for unit load sizes and costs)
2.	Introduction – high cost with low sales = negative profits
3.	Growth – sales increase, distribution expands, make to stock begins, 3PL warehousing needed, risk of too much inventory of demand signal inaccurate
4.	Maturity – most profitable, sales increase but slower
5.	Decline – market is saturated, declining demand, declining production, transition to make to order strategy to avoid excessive inventory

Life cycles and suppliers

-	Regulations require tracing materials back to their source
-	Establish way to handle returns and communicate improvements
-	Suppliers with shorter part life cycles than product can limit supply

Reverse logistics
-	Warranties
-	Space parts
-	Returns

Section D: Logistics Framework Notes


Types of organizational structures:

-	Functional structure with no logistics functional area – series of grain silos, where there is suboptimization and slow transfer of information. 
-	Functional structure with logistics functional area – other departments have no say in managing logistics. High cooperation is required.
-	Matrix – Director + supply chain + logistics 
-	Network – Process focused, from order receipt to delivery. Agile and reliant on information sharing.

Centralized (organized, shipping volume discounts) vs decentralized (more responsive to          customer)

Echelon: levels of supply chain nodes, focused on warehousing. Good for wide arrays of products

Direct: minimal warehouse #, inventory, direct shipping to demand.

Combined: uses both echelons and direct. Fast moving items are sent to echelons (close to customers) and slow-moving items are at centralized warehouse for direct delivery.

Flexible: Allow warehouse to communicate and share workloads. 

	Examples:

-	Ship a back order from a more distant warehouse.
-	Customer is equidistant from two warehouse, ship from highest inventory or capacity to balance workload.
-	Stock a master facility with a full line of products, support smaller warehouses with limited inventory. 
-	Cross-docking: Time orders from manufacturers to align outbound orders
-	Integrated service providers: can hold slow moving inventory, consolidation

Logistics relationships:
 
-	Contract: End date with no guarantee with penalties and termination causes
-	Ongoing relationship: contract, but with more information sharing and goals.
-	Leader/follower: supply chain integration started by channel master
-	Strategic alliance: integration through joint investments that increases performance of all companies involved. 
-	Enterprise extension: parties integrate processes, cultures, and information
Factors

-	Trust
-	Leadership
-	Power
-	Risk
-	Information sharing and visibility 

Types of collaboration:

-	Horizontal: suppliers share retailers so they share a warehouse
-	Quick response: JIT replenishment with high turnover from high changeovers. Fast transportation used.
-	Efficient: smooth flow between manufacturers and retailers, minimizes inventory using cross-docking, vendor-managed inventory
-	Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment
o	Strategy and planning: product mixes
o	Demand and supply management: forecast demand data and replenish together
o	Execution: order fulfillment and monitoring KPIs
o	Vendor-managed inventory (VMI): gives manufacturer responsibility for restocking its products, reduces bullwhip effect, more information on retail demand

Topic 3: Strategic Risk management

Supply chain risk: variety of possible events that can affect goods, services, funds or information resulting in quantitative or qualitative loss.

Risks
-	Tolerant vs averse to risk – set at organization strategy level 
-	Demand 
o	Low demand
o	Lower price than expected
-	Supply
o	Cost of material + labor higher than expected
o	Recalls or strikes
o	External relationships do not deliver promises or have unethical behavior.
-	Process 
o	Service failures or capacity constraints
o	Dysfunctional internal structures – silos, adversarial cultures, disjointed information systems
o	Failure to communicate strategic plans or demand data due to oversight or mistrust.
-	Financial risk
o	Your org or partner could experience financial failure
o	Currency exchange, the economy or credit availability
-	Environmental
o	Supply chain disruptions – disasters, war, or terrorism
o	Government regulations, interference, failure to invest in infrastructure, or instability.

Strategy opportunities and risks

Lean

-	Opportunities: less waste and buffer inventory
-	Risks: more stockouts or line stoppage after disruption

Few suppliers:

-	Opportunities: economies of scale
-	Risks: increases supply risk due to disaster or financial failure, quality recalls would result in widespread issues, replacing suppliers takes time

Low-count country sourcing
	
-	Opportunities: low labor costs
-	Risks: long lead times, IP theft, government appropriation

Contracting

-	Opportunities: focus on core competencies and cut costs
-	Risks: operations less visible, harder to coordinate

Supply chain security

-	Warehouse pilferage: No exceptions to warehouse yard access. Single gate. Rotate assignments. Audit case counts.

-	Truck hijacking: Instruct staff to hand over keys, avoid high-risk routes, technology 

-	Damage: Pallet-stacking limits, separate items in loads to prevent cross-contamination, proper packaging




Compliance

-	Customs regulations: classify goods properly, paying fair value, correct markings and labeling. Import/export regulations exist to collect taxes, ban illegal or substandard and prevent trade dumping. 
-	Prohibited goods: Limited for import/export between countries due to national interest or security concerns
-	Country of origin tracking: Regulations that help orgs qualify for beneficial product labeling (“Made in…” and trade agreement tax discounts
-	Air freight regulations: regulated by the international air transport association (IATA) and the international civil aviation organization (ICAO). Countries can restrict # of flights.
-	Trucking regulations: limit noise at night, driver time, ban trucks in certain areas
-	Rail regulations: rates, services issues, line sales, mergers and acquisitions, line abandonments, classifications, facilities, interchange traffic among carriers---- regulated by the Surface Transportation Board.
-	Safety Regulations:
o	FMCSA – motor carriers
o	US Coast guard – maritime safety
o	States – highways, traffic laws
o	Federal – Vehicle weight and trailer length
-	Anti-terrorism: Additional screening is needed, though partnerships like the Authorized Economic Operator program make it easier to cross

Social mandates
-	Voluntary initiatives
-	Consumer pressure – labor, environmental protections, treatment of local populations

Strategic risk tools
-	Identifying and managing exceptions
o	Determine gaps between desired and actual strategy 
▪	Internal - from change in business direction, merger or acquisition, internal resistance, complexity due to cultural differences
▪	External – disruptive technology, change in market, faster change in product’s life cycle
o	How to close gaps
▪	Reward critics for speaking up through anonymous surveys or brainstorming sessions
▪	Assign someone to analyze larger trends
-	Limiting complexity
o	Outsourcing imports and customs clearance
o	Fewer SKUs



SWOT analysis – strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats

-	Internal strengths and weaknesses: skill sets, reputation, input from customers and suppliers
-	External opportunities and threats: market trends, risk analysis, demographic change, customer needs, competitor pricing and offerings, emerging technology, taxes, laws, regulations
o	PESTEL – political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, environmental, and legal

Talent Acquisition and Management

Hierarchy of needs

-	Self-actualization – challenging work, growth
-	Esteem – reputation, recognition
-	Social – belonging
-	Safety – work environment, job security, useful benefits
-	Physiological needs – earnings, breaks

Survey of priorities
	
1.	Pay
2.	Challenging work
3.	Work-life balance
4.	Working with a talented team
5.	Appreciation for work
6.	Training/professional development


Talent 
-	Logistics professional shortage (especially drivers)
o	Turnover leads higher expenses passed on to the customer
-	Certification should be encouraged
-	Quality of management directly impacts retention
-	Warehouse manager should only manage 12 to 15 employees, exceeding labor will diminish their role.

Section F: Reengineering and Continuous Improvement

Improving an existing process or system
-	Reengineering – involves project management
-	Continuous improvement – step by step process to make work more efficient

Business process reengineering (BPR) – procedure that involves rethinking of business 

 



Continuous replenishment – supplier is notified of daily sales to avoid stockouts resulting an improvement in inventory turnover

Demand = predictable, lead time = long --- lean + make-to-stock

Demand = unpredictable, lead time = short --- agile methods

Demand = unpredictable, lead time = long ----agile + lean (leagile) which increases safety stocks

Lean production – minimization of all resources including time
-	Eliminate waste
o	Design 
o	Production
o	Supply chain management
-	Must be adopted by everyone

Just-in-time(JIT) 

-	Zero inventories
-	Short, consistent lead times
-	Small and frequent replenishment of inventoryu
-	High quality

Forms of waste

-	Transportation – excessive movement of people, things or information
-	Inventory – Storage of materials prior to demand signal
-	Motion – unnecessary handling, walking, driving, bending, lifting, reaching or turning
-	Waiting – idle time caused by lack of direction, instructions, information, parts or equipment
-	Overproduction – make more than immediately required
-	Overprocessing – higher-grade materials or tighter tolerances than required
-	Defects – Scrap, rework and erroneous documentation
-	Skills – worker underutilization or empowerment beyond capabilities


Japanese terms

-	Muda – activities that consume resources but create no customer value
-	Mura – demand or activities that are inconsistent or uneven
-	Muri – overburdening of works or processes

Push vs pull

-	JIT systems want to be pull, not push, though push is often required
-	Push 	
o	Traditional make-to-stock, forecasts are often wrong
-	Pull
o	Kanban – system of cards to signal demand
o	Customer > retailer > suppliers(s)

Agile Supply Chains: ability to respond quickly to unpredictable changes in customer needs by configuring operations. Orgs want to be agile because:

-	Demand and product requirements are unstable
-	Product lift cycles are short
-	Inventory becomes obsolete
-	Customer high expectations

Agile systems:

-	Require data sharing between echelons
-	Minimal finished goods inventory
-	Minimal lead times
-	Direct factory delivery to customer when possible
-	Collaborate production planning
-	Light manufacturing or geographic postponement within distribution 

Postponement: intentionally delays final production (assembly, production, packaging, tagging) until the latest time in the process to reduce risk

-	Light manufacturing – org needs to have sufficient space for good flow through
-	Geographic – moves inventory to key DCs but final delivery is triggered by demand

Lean plus agile – long lead times and unpredictable demand 

Six sigma – methodology to decrease process variation and improve product quality

-	Customer – performance, reliability, competitive price, on-time delivery, excellent service.
-	Process – Flowcharting process from outside looking in. reduce errors and variability. 
-	Employee – offer training at all levels



Sig sigma process and tools

-	Define – determine nature
-	Measure -existing performance vs data
-	Analyze – determine root cause
-	Improve – develop solutions
-	Control – monitor process until solutions are engrained

Continuous improvement: act of making incremental, regular improvements and upgrades to a process or product

Continuous process improvement: never-ending effort to expose and eliminate root causes of problems 

Kaizen: japanese term from improvement

Cost of poor quality: costs associated with performing a task incorrectly and/or generating unacceptable output. These costs would include the cost of noncomformities, inefficient, and lost opportunities

CPI steps:

-	Reducing variability in lead times
-	Improving a picking route

Plan-do-check-action (PDCA): 

1.	Plan
2.	Do
3.	Check
4.	Action

Continuous steps:

1.	Determine the process to be improved
2.	Gather and compile data on the as-is state
3.	Analyze the data and produce a to-be state
4.	Select the best method among alternatives
5.	Implement
6.	Sustain the new method




Continuous objectives

-	Improve quality
-	Improving productivity
-	Eliminating waste

Cost of poor quality: costs associated with doing a task incorrectly, which include nonconformities, inefficient processes and lost opportunities.

Employee involvement: uses experience, creative energy and intelligence by treating them with respect, keeping them informed and including them in decision-making processes.

Employee empowerment: practice of giving non-managerial employees the responsibility and the power to make decisions. 

Root cause analysis: ishikawi diagram is a tool to help determine root causes.

Value stream mapping visualizes flow of materials from supplier to customer, including all value and non-value-added time. Reduces waste, decreases flow time, make the process flow more efficient and effective
























Section F Quiz

Question 1

Question 4

What kind of waste would be easiest to identify by studying the bottom portion of a value stream map?

Waiting

Question 5

Which might be considered a form of waste under lean?

Performing quality control on incoming raw materials

Question 6

Which type of inventory might be relatively higher than normal in an agile system?

Work-in-process - manufacturing postponement

Question 7

Demand is roughly 500,000 and 800,000 units. Profit margins are low. Which solution would improve margins with fewest tradeoffs?

Produce 500,000 units in a low-labor-cost country and ship by ocean; then near-source remaining demand at agile facilities.

Question 8

Logistics professionals have been overburdened with expediting shipments, and this has led to a decrease in perfect orders. Using lean's problem-solving approach to waste, which is the most likely root cause of this issue?

Demand or activities that are inconsistent or uneven (mura)

Question 9

A manufacturing process is labor- and equipment-intensive, down to the final steps. The organization has put all product documentation online so there are no country-specific differences between products. What agile technique can the organization use if it has short lead times but high demand uncertainty?

Geographic postponement

“Geographic postponement moves inventory to key distribution centers (DCs), but forward deployment to the final DC or retail location is postponed until customer orders trigger the movements.”








Question 10

An organization wants to set up a kaizen team to implement a kaizen blitz in order to address inefficiencies and waste in the order management process, since it is adding to an already long lead time. Customer service has been handling complaints, sales wants to expedite orders quite often, and manufacturing and procurement want to be notified of orders sooner. Which is a best practice for this kaizen team?

Keep the team as small as possible, perhaps involving only IT and order management professionals.

Question 11

Which might be part of your job as a logistics professional if your organization adopts lean manufacturing?

Determining an efficient way to customize a logistics service for one customer

Question 12

Product: The product ordered is the product provided.

Quantity: The product ordered is provided in the ordered quantity.

Delivery: The location and delivery time ordered are met upon receipt.

Customer order: The product is delivered to the specified entity.

Documentation supporting the order: All documents are accurate, complete, and on time.

Product condition: The product is delivered and faultlessly installed (as applicable) according to 
specifications with no damage, is customer-ready, and is accepted by the customer.

Question 16

Which is a tradeoff of pursuing responsiveness that postponement tries to mitigate?

Loss of economies of scale from having shorter production runs

Question 17

An organization has to have long lead times because the goods it sells are low margin and have many competitors. The high competition and high substitutability among brands means that demand is also highly unpredictable. What type of supply chain would be best for this organization?

“Leagile”

Question 18

Which is an example of a lean objective put into practice?

Warehouse pickers wear walking chronometers and compete on fewest steps per line item picked. ----reduces waste 



















Retail Compliance

Background

ADX Theriac decided to push these standards out to their U.S.–based ADX stores. ADX Theriac started using an on-time in full (OTIF) policy with monthly compliance targets of 65 percent for all LTL orders and 85 percent for all TL orders starting January 1. Compliance requires an order to arrive (complete) within a two-day window, neither too early nor too late. Reliability Logistics is in charge of ensuring that their portion of the deliveries are in compliance and for enforcing compliance with the suppliers and carriers who make deliveries to their DCs. Failures on the part of Reliability or the carriers and suppliers they work with results in a penalty of 3 percent of the invoice, a cost that is shared with the responsible party.

At the end of the first month, Reliability and its supply chain partners are in compliance with the LTL orders, but TL orders are at 80 percent and are noncompliant. Supply chain and senior leadership meet to address this problem and explore possible solutions or changes in strategy. Several avenues for further exploration are determined:

What information is needed from the retailer, and how can we better partner with ADX Theriac to get better data?

How can we align the supply chain to achieve these goals? The supply chain includes Reliability Logistics’ warehousing, order management, and local delivery, plus third-party carriers used for line-haul transport and the supply chain planning and operations of multiple suppliers.
Are our suppliers’ order fill rates acceptable, or do they need to improve operations?
How can we ensure that any changes we make will actually result in fewer cases of noncompliance?

What is the cost ramification to make these changes, and how does this compare to being charged the 3 percent penalty?

Questions & Answers

When delving into the question of what information is needed from the retailers, what information is likely to be of the most use in reducing the risk of noncompliance?

Details on the retailers’ rules of trade, for example, how they mark specific deliveries as compliant versus noncompliant





ADX Theriac wants Reliability Logistics to be capable of just-in-time rapid deliveries, especially for hot new products such as the CBD oils they plan to start aggressively selling. Which is the most viable solution that would also minimize the final price of the product to customers?


Set cycle stocks of CBD oils at Reliability’s DCs equal to one full order for each retail store served by that DC

Reliability Logistics decides to look into the CBD oil manufacturer’s recent incomplete order delivery. What is the most important thing to look into from a future retail compliance perspective?

Whether they have the available manufacturing capacity to meet the required order fill rate

What sort of change management would serve Reliability Logistics the best to get everyone aligned to this “new world order”?

Pull together a cross-functional team with expertise from this and other supply chain partners who will craft a cohesive message selling the importance of everyone doing their part.

The cross-functional team weighs the costs of replacing some logistics information systems to better align with the retailers’ systems and reconfiguring other systems to include retail compliance rules. The team determines that this will cost the equivalent of six months’ worth of penalties. They estimate that if no change is made they will have penalties in half the months of the year. What should the team recommend to senior management?

Make the change despite the high cost, since accumulating penalties is likely to eventually prompt ADX Theriac to find a new logistics partner.

Topic 3: Transportation requirements and network size

Business strategy and customer requirements

-	EX: 90% of customers getting their goods within 72 hours of order receipt at an average fill rate of 94%
-	Adjusting how many and how far warehouses are to demand affects service levels

Steps:

1.	Determine customer requirements and network servicing expectations
a.	Identify customer segments
b.	Min/max service levels 
c.	Frequency of orders
2.	Calculate the threshold service level
a.	Cheapest method to serving all customers given transportation cost, safety stock, delivery timing and frequency
b.	Economic cost map visualizes cost breakdown of DC
3.	Use sensitivity analysis to adjust factors one at a time and determine the incremental cost difference of increasing any given factor 
a.	Changing one variable to see system change
b.	Cost of safety follows the square root rule
i.	Estimates impact on safety stock of adding/deleting warehouses
c.	Pareto analysis: 
i.	A = 96%
ii.	B = 92%
iii.	C = 85%
4.	Present the alternatives and their cost differences and finalize strategy
a.	Decision of cost of each service level can be determined

Analysis of transportation requirements for the customer
-	Driven by demand forecast and demand management activities
-	Consider volume of SKUs first

Equation to determine if adding DC is a net benefit (if top is less than or equal to bottom):

Sum(TL transport + TL processing) 
/ average( # of TLs) +
 average shipment DC cost + average shipment local delivery 

<= 

Processing cost of average shipment + direct freight cost of average shipment

Inventory locations and levels, order size and frequency

-	Average aggregate inventory = order qty/2 + safety stock + in-transit inventory
-	Adding DC locations = 
o	Stock per DC decreases
o	Safety stock will increase
o	Faster in-transit days
o	Reduced cycle time due to distance to customer

Number of warehouses caused by:

Modeling Approaches

Model definition: tool with inputs, processes and outputs

-	Inputs: variables or data
-	Processes: functions performed on the inputs
-	Outputs: business information

Heuristics: form of problem solving in which the results have been determined by experience or intuition instead of optimization.

-	Forecasting
-	Lot sizing
-	Determining production
-	Staff
-	Inventory levels

Cost-volume analysis: compares the fixed + variable costs of locations

Assumptions:

-	Fixed costs are constant
-	Variable costs are at a steady linear rate
-	Only one product is being shipped

Total cost = fixed cost + (variable cost x volume)

Operating leverage: determines at that level break-even is reached

-	High leverage = more fixed costs, but more profits per sale. Break-even is slower to achieve.
-	Low leverage = High proportion of variable costs, but lower profit per sale. Break-even is easier to achieve.

Examples of operating leverage

-	Denver
o	Low fixed costs due to low rent
o	High variable costs due to longer distances
-	Seattle
o	Middle level of fixed and variable costs
-	Los Angeles
o	High fixed costs due to automation
o	Low variable costs due to proximity to customers

 





Cross-over unit examples

Below is a table of various costs

Denver-Seattle example

4,000,000 (Seattle) – 2,000,000 (Denver) / 615/unit(Denver) – 385/unit(seattle) =

2,000,000 / 230 per unit = 8,696 units



City	Fixed Costs	Variable Costs	Maximum Units	Total Cost at Maximum Units
Denver	$2,000,000	$615	26,000	$17,990,000
Seattle	$4,000,000	$385	26,000	$14,010,000
Los Angeles	$8,000,000	$115	26,000	$10,990,000




Crossover Points
Denver–Seattle	8,696	Units
Seattle–Los Angeles	14,815	Units
Denver–Los Angeles	12,000	Units




Interpreting the graph

If forecast < 8,696, Denver
If forecast between 8,696 and 14,815, seattle
If forecast > 14,815, Los angles


 


Weighted Factor Rating Method: places various levels of priority on both quantitative and qualitative factors for a location decision. Usually summed to 100%

Center-of-gravity Method: locating DCs at approximately the location representing the minimum transportation costs between plants, DCs, and markets

-	Coordinate-based (x,y)
-	Based on shipping volume


Formula to calculate the center gravity

-	X: (8*8000) +(16*9000) etc… / 38,000 = 12
-	Y: (10*8000) + (9*8000) etc…. / 38,000 = 8

(12,8) is in Frankfurt. Map is below.

Location	x Coordinate	y Coordinate	Shipping Volume
London	8	10	8,000
Warsaw	16	9	9,000
Madrid	5	3	4,000
Hamburg	12	10	11,000
Rome	13	3	6,000
Center of gravity	12	8	38,000

-	Identify and document risks
-	Categorize and prioritize risks
-	Quantitatively analyze risk if desired
-	Pick a basic risk response
o	Accept: take no action
o	Avoid: changing a plan to eliminate risk or protect plan objectives
o	Transfer: have another party assume the risk
o	Mitigate: Reduce exposure to risk in terms of likelihood or impact
-	Develop preventative and contingent action plans
-	Implement action plans
-	Regularly meet to review risk response status

Value at risk (VAR): sum of all of the expected monetary values (EMV). If net sum is positive, then the rewards outweigh the risks. Formula = probability x net monetary impact

International Security measures

Organizations

-	International Chamber of commerce
o	Incoterms
o	Uniform customs and practice for documentary credit
-	World customs organization
o	183 countries
o	Helps clear rapidly low-risk shipments
o	Secure and facilitate global trade framework (SAFE) standardizes ASNs

Business Continuity Planning: plans to ensure that an organization is capable of continuing to deliver products or services at acceptable predefined levels following disruption.

Business continuity management system (BCMS): establishes, implements, operates, monitors, reviews, maintains and improves an organization’s ability of delivering products or services.

ISO 22301: specifies requirements for setting up and managing an effective continuity management system.

Insurance

Ways to insure against loss:

-	Risk transfer to 3rd party (usually insurance company)
-	Self-insurance: requires large amount of money, usually large importers who ship low-value goods and can absorb loss
-	Mixed approach by setting high deductibles

Cargo insurance: dictated by incoterms, carriers have max liability terms

Commercial property insurance: Facility must be damaged or inaccessible

Business interruption insurance: damage is sufficient to shut down all operations, pays salries, relocation expenses and lost new income

Contingent business interruption insurance: Insured customer or supplier losses provide you with reimbursement for lost profits or other transferred risks.

Trade disruption insurance: insurance for trade disruptions not involving physical asset damage. Property, marine and political risk unrelated to your or your supplier’s assets.Addresses nondelivery, project cancellations, government appropriations. Fills in insurance gaps

Global logistics insurance: Customs bonds, bailee (holders of others’ cargo), consolidator liability, foreign port operator insurance, ship hull insurance. Truck liability

Cyber insurance: IT failures and cybercrime

Value stream mapping project


 

Note that the local DC on the left and on the right is the same DC. (The vehicles return to their local DC at the end of the milk run.) Note also that the organization has created a number of metrics related to overall vehicle efficiency (not included here for brevity), including metrics for excess driver breaks, excess load time, speed loss, quality delays, clients not served, unscheduled vehicle time, scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance time, administrative efficiency, and so on.
Here are some key points regarding the “as is” value stream map:
-	Drivers help load their vehicles, but this reduces available time for driving.
-	Drivers do all of their own unloading at each location.
-	The fill loss is 30 percent, meaning that on average there is 30 percent unused available space in vehicles.
-	On average, drivers finish their routes with 23 minutes remaining, but this is not enough time to reduce the number of vehicles and drivers.
-	Routings provided by corporate do not use dynamic rerouting to deal with traffic issues, but dynamic rerouting software could reduce average route times by 10 percent.


Question 1

How could ADX Wholesale Pharmaceuticals innovate to help implement its parent organization’s strategy to create a reverse supply chain drop zone for customers of online retailers?

Have grocery suppliers deliver to the break-bulk DCs and then include these groceries in local DC deliveries and their milk runs.


Question 2

ADX Wholesale Pharmaceuticals determines that it may be feasible to accept groceries in their current cold chain since they have available warehouse space and the total groceries would occupy about 20 percent of a given vehicle’s cargo space on average. What additional costs would this change create?

It will increase warehouse labor costs and require more time per driver stop.

Question 3

Which is the best way listed to accommodate the larger average amount of time required per driver stop, assuming that all of the options would fix the problem?

Have drivers start their shift with a fully loaded truck and invest in dynamic routing software to reduce the average driving time.

Question 4

On a trial run, a driver did a milk run with pharmaceuticals plus groceries for the subsidiary retail locations. An analyst rode along and timed activities. While the grocery delivery add-on increased average time in a retail store by about 10 minutes, deliveries to non-affiliated doctors and pharmacies make up a significant number of the stops, and these have no grocery deliveries. The average time per stop therefore increased by only five minutes. If the average times to the first retailer, between retailers, and for the return are reduced by 10 percent using dynamic routing software, and the driver starts with a fully loaded truck (which adds 30 minutes to the available time), will this be sufficient to compensate for an extra five minutes per average stop? (Assume that if rounding is needed, planners round toward the more conservative estimate of savings.)


Yes, and it will also improve vehicle utilization metrics.



Question 5

What would be another way to improve vehicle utilization that the organization could add to their “to be” version of the value stream map?

Have the driver drop the groceries off, but get the store employees to place them in the cooler whenever someone is available.

-	Manufacturers spend up to 9 to 15% on returns
-	Only 20% have a dedicated logistics strategy to effectively manage returns

Reverse supply chain: planning and controlling of the processes of moving goods from the point of consumption back to the point of origin of repair, reclamation, recycling or disposal.

Supplier > manufacturer > distributor > wholesaler > retailer > end user


Returns: step in the process where a customer sends product back: defective, damaged, out of season, outdated, didn’t meet expectations, or represented excess inventory.

Reasons of returns

-	Customer changing their mind
-	Order entry
-	Recalls: defect or hazard, can be a financial obligation
-	Overstocks: retailer ordered more than what they can sell
-	Obsolete products: nearing the end of their product life cycle
-	Packaging: inconsistent marketing of the product itself

Return policies

-	Zero returns
-	Return rate allowance
-	Discount offers
-	Accept only defective returns
-	Having receivers hold until they have truckload qtys to ensure its economical
-	Gatekeeping: returns only happen after speaking to customer service, reduces level of returns
-	Executive’s guide to reverse logistics (Greve and Davis)
o	Product can be repaired = manufacturer absorbs repair costs
o	Not working properly and under warranty = manufacturer pays costs
o	Not recalled and not working = customer pays repair costs
-	Best practices
o	Retailers deduct charges for returned products and processing and freight costs for shipping returned items from the outstanding payables they have with the manufacturer
o	Manufacturers do not accept or credit in any way product returns from retailers that do not comply with the terms and conditions of ther sales agreements.
o	Defective or recalled products – manufacturer typically pays the freight directly or indirectly
o	Leading manuf. Of high tech products are more strict and do not pay handling or consolidation fees
o	Secondary market buyers pay for their own transportation carrier
o	Product may be shipped using reusable packaging and a return label.






Internal or outsourced reverse logistics?

Internal core competency

-	Provide firm with competitive advantage by making returns easier for customers and by promoting its reputation
-	Firm can monetize some of its efforts by tracking and documenting its income from various methods of handling returns.
-	Increasing demand from customers, shareholders, and governments for products that are recyclable, resuable, and less likely to end up in landfills – viewed as unfriendly.
-	Centralizing returns allows for scale and identify returned product versions correctly


Disposition of Returns


 





6 ways a return can be handled

1.	Return to stock
2.	Return to manufacturer or producer
3.	Liquidate
4.	Donate
5.	Recycle
6.	Dispose

Reverse logistics hierarchy – least to most wasteful

1.	Reduce
2.	Reuse
3.	Recycle
4.	Recover energy during disposal
5.	Dispose in responsible landfill

Remanufacturing: worn-out products are restored to like-new condition. 

Recycling: reintroduction of partial processed product

Repurpose: Take something and use it for something else not originally intended

Recovery: Collection of used and discarded products, components, and materials.

Asset recovery: Cost-effective classification and recovery of usable raw material from product returns, obsolete, or excess goods, scrap and waste.

Donations: many companies do this even if they reach their tax limit

Scrap: material outside of specifications and possessing characteristics that make rework impractical

Salvage: property that, because of its worn, damaged, deteriorated, or incomplete condition or nature, has no prospect of sale or use without major repairs or alterations, but that has some value in excess of its scrap value.

Closed-loop systems: system that accounts for the return flow of products for reuse, asset recovery, or recycling in a way that is cost-effective and maximizes returns.

-	Beer kegs: full of beer when sold and can be returned and refilled for a price
-	Redbox: free-standing movie rental kiosk, reuses discs and cases
-	Printer ink cartridges: when empty, are sent via prepaid mailers back to the company for cleaning, inspection and refilling. 
-	Commercial tire casings sent to a tire retreader who adds new treads


Kodak single-use camera closed-loop supply process:

1.	Supplier sends materials to Kodak
2.	Kodak produces single-use cameras, shipped to retailers
3.	Retailers display the cameras and sell to customers
4.	Customers use the cameras to take photographs and then return them with the film inside to a photo finisher
5.	Photo finisher develops film and creates prints and are sent to the customer
6.	Phot finish sends the used empty cameras in batches to a collection center
7.	Collection center sorts the used cameras, shipped to a subcontractor
8.	Subcontractor cleans and disassembles the cameras, replaces parts as needed and completes final inspection of the cameras, which are shipped to Kodak.
9.	Kodak reloads camera bodies with film and ships cameras to retailers.

Advantages to forward and reverse flow closed loops (example above):

-	Capture a significant portion of the product’s original value
-	Used products are recycled and therefore do not become part of landfills
-	Easier for the manufacturer to balance supply and demand


Optimizing reverse logistics

-	Many firms do not want to deal with product returns
-	Managing reverse logistics
o	Weighing PROs and CONs of establishing its own returns center or using a third party.
o	Senior management must have buy-in to the chosen strategy.
o	High-level finance/IT directors should be involved.
o	Reducing cycle times is crucial
o	Returns should be forecasted
o	Dispositions of returns need to be done consistently

Dekitting: removal of accessories or parts kits from a product and returning either the kit or the main product without the kit to the store. May also refer to the allowance of the resale of kits or products without their parts kits.

Key technologies:

-	The internet
-	Enterprise resources planning
-	Electronic data interchange
-	Internet of things
-	Radio frequency identification
-	Returns management system
-	Reverse payments process
o	20 to 30 inventory turns is a goal for collection center
-	Blockchain: acts as a distributed ledger that can reduce under and over-ordering, parts compatibility

Reverse Logistics costs

-	Activity-based costing: labor, transportation, inventory carrying costs, packaging, transactional, document costs
-	Forward flow analyses and costs plus handling charges: per ton-mile costs + sorting, packaging costs

Adds revenue

-	Returned product liquidation revenue
-	Recycling revenue
-	Repair revenue
-	Restocking charges and warranty/service program fees
-	Increase in sales from warranties, remanufacture programs, environmental reputation, etc
-	Capture tax savings or incentive program benefits

Challenges

-	Forecasting volumes
-	Storage
-	Cost
-	Traceability






Capacity Planning and Demand Management

Forecasting: business function that attempts to predict sales and use of products so they can be purchased or manufactured in appropriate quantities in advance.

Forecasting horizons

-	Long-term: 3+ years, new products, retire others, enter or exit markets, plan facilities and capacity for supply, manufacturing, transportation, warehousing and retail.
-	Medium-term: 1-2 years, budgets, production planning, shorter-term capacity planning (hiring drivers, warehouse employees or negotiating contract extensions).
-	Short-term: less than 1 year, what to purchase or product, logistics services to schedule

Nature of forecasting: consumer demand volatility creates uncertainty within supply chain

Bias: consistent deviation from the mean in one direction (high or low).

Forecasting must create more value than it costs to gather data.

Two principles of forecasting:

-	Aggregate forecasts, such as families or groups of products are more reliable than granular forecasts of individual items
-	Forecasting into the future becomes inherently less reliable.

How to improve forecasting accuracy:

-	Check data sources and data input methods and results for accuracy and reliability.
-	Use demand history than sales history. 
o	Sales history – sales returns + unfulfilled orders + drop ships + estimated loss of sales due to stockouts
-	Use end-consumer demand rather than DC demand
-	Include a margin of error in units or monetary amounts with each forecast to get people used to looking at accuracy.
-	Adhere to organizational targets for forecast quality and acceptable error rates and adjust methods when forecast is missing its targets.
-	Track the accuracy of forecasts before and after expert modifications
-	Keep forecast models as simple as possible.

Bullwhip effect: an extreme change in the supply position upstream, generated by a small change in demand downstream.


Factors affecting demand

-	Trends: general upward or downward movement of a variable overtime
o	Linear
o	Exponential
-	Cycles: shifts in demand lasting longer than one year
-	Seasonality: predictable repetitive pattern of demand measured within a year
-	Random variation: fluctuation in data that is caused by uncertain or random occurrences
o	Common cause: several factors, not modelled due for simplicity’s sake
o	Special cause: assignable
▪	Trends
▪	Seasonality
▪	Causes
-	Promotions: discounts or advertising
o	Promotions explain 50-80% sales variation
-	Minimum quantity requirements: smallest amount of product that can be ordered

Forecasting process:

1.	Determine the purpose of the forecast
2.	Determine level of aggregation and what will be forecasted
a.	Family, product or SKU
3.	Determine the time horizon
4.	Visualize the data
5.	Choose the forecasting method or model
6.	Prepare the data
7.	Test the forecast using historical data
8.	Forecast
9.	Perform sales and operations planning
10.	Periodically review and improve models for accuracy

Qualitative forecasting techniques:

-	Personal insight
-	Sales force estimates
-	Panel consensus
-	Market research
-	Visionary forecasting
-	Delphi method: survey experts



Quantitative forecasting techniques: historical demand data is used to project future demand.

-	Time series: projects historical data patterns into the future
o	Simple moving average
o	Weighted moving average
o	Exponential smoothing
-	Visualizing: able to spot seasonality
-	Deseasonalizing: generating a seasonal index


 


Simple and weighted moving averages, exponential smoothing

-	Simple moving average: average of demand from several preceding periods
-	Weighted moving averages: places weights on periods being averaged, putting emphasis on more recent periods
-	Exponential smoothing: Involves weighting, minimizes lag from trend shift

 
Reseasonalizing: multiplying the deseasonalized data by given periods season index

Associative forecasting (casual, correlation, explanatory, or extrinsic): uses one or more variables that are believed to affect demand in order to forecast future demand.

-	Predictor = independent variable
-	Element being predicted = dependent variable

Simple regression: y = mx + b

Multiple regression: has 1+ predictive variables. EX: marketing spend added to roofing sales analysis.

Distribution channels

-	Supplier > customer
-	Supplier > DC > manufacturer > business 
-	Supplier > DC > manufacturer > DC > customer

Retail distribution channel

-	Manufacturer’s DC
-	Retailer’s warehouse
-	3PL
-	Wholesaler
-	Direct delivery via owned vehicles, carrier or parcel service
-	Retailer direct pickup
Business-to-business: conducted over internet between companies

-	Able to quickly communicate service failures, damage reports, and inventory levels

Interpreting forecasts: errors lead to higher costs

Forecast error: difference between actual and forecast demand

Absolute percentage error: A-F/A

Forecast accuracy: 1-forecast error as a percentage

Mean absolute deviation: absolute period errors/# of periods

Mean squared error (MSE): Magnifies errors, makes then positive
	MSE = (sum of errors for each period)^2 / number of periods



Mean absolute percentage error: ratio of errors to the actual demand
	MAPE = (each month absolute value) / 12 (months) *100 = %

Tracking signal: Sum of forecast errors / mean absolute deviatION
-	Companies will set a target value (let’s say 4) so anything beyond that triggers a forecast review

Measuring by SKU

-	Forecast bias
o	if signal is always negative, we are over-forecasting
o	If positive, under-forecasting
-	Suitability of the forecasting method:
o	If it remains in a specified range (4 in this case), method is working correctly

Forecasting exception management

-	Verify logic of forecast
-	Verify data and assumptions, input errors
-	Product groupings
-	Note forecast assumptions separately
-	If forecast is deemed valid, act upon it (decrease or increase capacity)


Logistics demand forecasting starts with sales forecast which will be translated to staffing, equipment, and contracted services

3-to-5 year forecast done for strategic planning will help logistics professionals determine size and number of warehouses.

Annual forecast determines staffing levels and equipment.

Operational weekly forecasting determines warehouse worker scheduling.

o	Product family drives long-term forecast
-	Demand strategy
o	Growth: beginning of life cycle
o	Portfolio: multiple products or services
o	Positioning: postponement, geographic position, agile manufacturing
o	Investment: which channels deserve greater capital investment
-	Demand planning: using forecasting to construct demand estimates (high, low, lumpy, continuous). Aggregated by product family, location, life cycle.
-	Supply planning: detail organizations capabilities and resources required to meet the demand plan
o	Production: aggregate output by product family as a monthly rate. Used to calculate cost of inventory.
o	Resource: equipment, facilities, labor, supplier capacity
o	Inventory: sets period target ending inventory for comparison against actual min/max values
o	Distribution requirements plan specifies logistics resources and warehouse/ transportation capacities needed to move inventory through planned channels
o	Performance metrics and targets: specifying targets enables control
-	Production planning:
o	Chase: increases/decreases production to match seasonal demand, requiring flexible workforce and idle equipment at times
o	Level: produces a steady amount, inventory accumulates during low demand periods.
o	Hybrid: mixes chase and level, outsources near seasonal peaks
o	Production rates
▪	Too low = overheard > profit
▪	High = overtime and quality issues destroy profit
o	Resource planning
▪	Equipment, labor and any other productive capability that adds value through production, storage, or shipping
▪	Bill of resources lists all resources needed to make one unit of the average product in a family

▪	Demand plan for next 18 months
▪	Prior demand plan
▪	Assumptions made
▪	Planned branding, marketing and sales promotions activities
▪	Key risks, opportunities, economic trends, competitor actions
▪	Subtleties and uncertainties
▪	Events and issues of note, decisions that were made

o	 
-	Communicating demand 
o	Demand sensing: collecting data on actual orders
▪	POS
▪	Open orders per period
o	Communicate soon and regularly with a structure
-	Influencing demand:
o	Product management, marketing and sales
o	External balancing: price and adjustments in lead time
▪	Price increases will turn customers to alternatives
▪	Price decreases help with surplus inventory
▪	Bulk purchase discounts
▪	Payment terms
▪	Credit approval policies
▪	Increase lead times: may turn away customers if too long
▪	Positive contribution margin: net profit increases while sales increases. Too much variety can be unsustainable.
-	Managing and prioritizing demand
o	Policy: indicate who is allowed to manage and prioritize demand
▪	Delegating to sales will create conflicts as they are naturally motivated by customers’ best interests
o	Process: Fulfill demand when it is feasible and will increase marginal profits
▪	Fulfilling demand later
▪	Delaying other orders to meet customer’s date
▪	Offering substitute
o	Time frame: change priority only if there is an impact to profitability

Constraint management: (EX) warehouse capacity when a new product line is offered while still working to sell off the old product line

1.	Identify constraint

Customer orders: actual demand

Projected available balance: running sum of on-hand inventory – requirements plus scheduled receipts and planned orders

Available to promise: uncommitted portion of a company’s inventory and planned production maintained in the master schedule to support customer-order promising.

Order promising: making a delivery commitment

Master production schedule: reflects anticipated build schedule. 

Interplant demand: one plant’s need for a part is produced by another plant within the same organization

Time fence: policy to limit changes in operations during a period.

-	Slushy: there is room to negotiate in the form of tradeoffs. Master scheduler can make those decisions.
-	Liquid: All changes are permissible as long as they don’t violate the limits set in the production plan or by the policy in the sales and operations plan.

Projected available balance = beginning inventory + additional supply – demand

Available to promise (ATP): inventory on-hand + items scheduled to arrive

Material requirements planning: uses bill of material data, inventory and master production to schedule to calculate requirements for materials. 

Dependent demand: directly related to or derived from the bill of material structure for other items of end product. 

Independent demand: Finished foods, parts required for destructive testing, service part requirements

80-20 rule: 80% of sales or costs come from 20% of the possible causes

Implementing the CRM process:

1.	Sort customers into profitability tiers

b.	Activity-based costing: How, how much, what and when a customer order:
i.	Operating profit contribution: gross profit – (invoices x average cost/invoice)
c.	Cost to serve costs of each business activities
2.	Determine service levels
a.	Different product/service packages given to different segments within a tier, providing the best service for higher-profitability customers
b.	Same product/service package offered to everyone with varying quality and service levels by profitability tier
c.	Same product/service package and the same service level can be offered to all customers – easiest to administer, creates higher risk of losing profitable customers
3.	Service level steps
a.	Identify what each profitability tier values
b.	Categorize service components: pre-transaction, transaction, post-transaction
c.	Prioritize elements of customer service by profit tier or segment
d.	Benchmark against competitors to establish relative service level
e.	Perform gap analysis
f.	Design product/service packages that will meet or exceed minimum service

o	raw materials
o	work-in-process items
-	Support activities 
o	Maintenance
o	Repair
o	Operating supplies
-	Customer service
o	Finished goods

Decoupling: separates supply from demand so customer demand can be filled from independent inventories.
Economy of scale: larger volumes of production reduce unit cost
Bullwhip effect
-	Occurs in push / make – to – stock systems
-	Delays in communication from end customer data result in variability and extra inventory on-hand
-	Supply variability also affects this as well
Level of service: percent of orders satisfied by production schedule to satisfy customers’ requested delivery dates and quantities
-	Make to stock calculation variations
o	% of orders picked complete from stock
o	% of line items picked complete
o	% of total dollar demand picked complete
Fill rate: % of time units were shipped on schedule
Stockout: lack of materials, components or finished goods
On-time schedule performance: % of meeting the customer’s originally negotiated delivery date.
Stakeholder perceptions of inventory
-	Inventory shrinkage: reductions in actual quantities of stock due to scrap, theft, deterioration, evaporation (etc)
-	Financial managers want the value of inventory lower (to improve return on assets)
-	Operations managers want higher inventory levels to improve productivity
-	Sales and marketing want to maximize customer service levels and inventory, so objectives are not missed
-	Customers want the right product at the right time, so they want high service levels
Inventory types
-	Operating: what is needed to satisfy forecast demand
-	Excess: will be used within the planning time frame
-	Surplus: Beyond planning time frame and would not have been ordered in the first place
-	Inactive: wasted assets that drags down profitability 
o	Subaru still holds on to “dead” SKUs to ensure high customer service levels




Inventory levels may be too high for the following reasons:
-	Unreliable suppliers
-	Lack of confidence in forecast
-	Demand characteristics that make forecasting difficult
-	Production problems causing delays or rework
Reducing the product cycle time
-	Examine each step to find efficiencies and compress time
-	Reducing inventory lead times and safety stock throughout the pipeline\
o	Order sooner and using JIT repeatedly 
-	Faster transportation options
Functions of inventory
-	Serves demand for raw materials and finished goods
-	Smooths the impact of fluctuations in supply and demand
-	Buffers against uncertainty in supply and demand
-	Creates cost-savings opportunities through enabling economies of scale or various hedging tactics
Lot size: amount of a particular item that is ordered from the plant or a supplier
Cycle stock: depletes gradually as customer orders are fulfilled
Pipeline stock: inventory in-progress and in-transit to DC. Has impact on:
-	Order transmission
-	Order processing
-	Scheduling
-	Shipping
-	Transportation
-	Receiving
-	Stocking
-	Review time
Anticipation inventories: additional inventory above basic pipeline stock to cover demand
Issues with aligning supply and demand
-	Geographical specialization 
-	Decoupling supply and demand
-	Seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand



Inventory threats
-	Forecast may not have considered the impact of improved economic conditions, thus understating demand
-	Shipments may be delayed in transit due to weather, traffic, carrier issues, or other causes.
-	Product defect may require replacement and may draw inventory down unexpectedly.
Safety stock: planned to be inventory to protect against fluctuations in demand or supply
Hedge inventory: inventory build up for unplanned speculations like riots or strikes
Economies of scale within supply chain:
-	Procurement – when suppliers offer volume discounts
-	Production – when runs are longer
-	Transportation – larger order = higher economical tier

Order cancellation effects:
1.	Erosion of the customer relationship
2.	Reputation suffers
3.	End customer finds alternatives, thus ending future orders
Module 6 Section B: Inventory Control, Strategy, and Policy
Types of demand:
-	Independent: determined by forecasting, safety stocks usually required
-	Dependent: requirement for independent demand inventory
o	Vertical: SKU required for the production of another SKU
o	Horizontal: combined to form one SKU (kitting)
-	Dual: Same parts used to manufacture (dependent) and in repair (independent)
Fixed order quantity system: triggers re-ordering at a point 
Order point: set inventory level where, if the total stock on hand plus on order falls below that point, action is taken to replenish the stock. 
Order point = anticipated demand x lead time
-	EX: Mobile phones
o	Demand = 200 / day
o	Lead time = 3 days
o	Order point = 200 * 300 = 600
Lot-for-lot: generates planned orders in quantities equal to the net requirements in each period
Point of sale: relief of inventory and computation of sales data at the time and place of sales through bar coding or magnetic media and equipment
Master production schedule provides the time-phased information required to know how much to reorder

Economic order quantity: type of fixed order quantity model that determines the amount of an item to be purchased or manufactured at one time
EOQ = Square root ( (2 * Annual usage in units *Order costs) / (annual carrying cost % * unit cost))
Exceptions to EOQ
-	Quantity discounts: unit cost decreases as the lot size increases, carrying costs mya increase as well
-	Joint replenishment: coordinating the lot sizing and order release decision for related items
-	Transportation costs
Before using EOQ:
-	Qualitative judgment must be done after calculating EOQ
-	EOQ is indicative, but not precise
-	More demand variability = less validity of EOQ
Fixed order period approach: method of inventory planning that measures actual inventory levels at regular intervals of time

 




Min-max system: 
-	Min = order point (minimum amount to demand during replenishment lead time)
-	Max = order up to point (max safety stock buffer)
-	Recommended when sum of available and on-order inventory is at or below the min
-	Not used for external suppliers, only internal DC transfers
Just-In-Time (JIT): keep inventory low with fast transit
Kanban: standard containers or lot sizes with a single card attached to each
Managing exceptions, anomalies, constraints, and conditions of uncertainty
-	Effects of uncertainty
o	Safety lead time: protect against fluctuations
-	Calculating standard deviation in Units
o	SD = measurement of dispersion of data of a variable
Overstocks: supply in excess of demand
Mean absolute deviation: average of the absolute values
Cycle service level: the probability of not having a stockout in one ordering cycle
Vendor managed inventory: businesses share inventory management responsibilities with their suppliers
-	Covered products defined
-	Order points and order quantities defined
-	What data is shared
Consigned stocks: inventories that are in the possession of customers, dealers, agents and brokers, but remain the property of the manufacturer by agreement 
-	Customer pays for inventory only when withdrawn from inventory
ABC Analysis of inventory: classification of a group of items in decreasing order of annual dollar volume
-	Determine levels of safety stock
-	Provide appropriate levels of inventory counting
-	Locate SKUs in individual warehouses
-	Check for expired items
-	Set service level targets
Dead stock: stock that has no sales within a 12 month period

-	Customer importance
-	Relationships to other items
-	Velocity or turns
Transaction points:
-	Order is received and checked
-	Defective portion of the order may be returned to the supplier
o	Remainder of the order is put into inventory

-	Loss of stock through waste is recorded
-	Picking of finished goods from inventory is recorded
Creating an effective inventory transaction system:
-	Handling policies
-	Development of processes and tools
-	Training
-	Commitment to auditing
Continuous review system: checked whenever change in inventory level occurs
Visual review system: simple inventory control system where the inventory re-ordering is based on looking at the amount of inventory on hand
Two-bin inventory system: working and excess
Inventory accuracy: usually 95% to 99%
Cycle counting: inventory counted on a regular basis
-	ABC: A items are counted more often compared to B and C
Approaches to cycle counting:
-	Zone method: conducts count area by area until complete
-	Doing counts before orders are put away
-	Counting during picking
-	Frequency of cycle count triggered by the number of items shipped
Days inventory outstanding = inventory on hand / average daily use
Weeks of supply: inventory on hand / average weekly use
Order fill rate: number of items or dollars shipped on schedule for a specific time period

Less developed countries rely on manual unloading of ships by stevedores, who balance smaller loads on their head and shoulders.
Modes:
-	Dry bulk: coal, grain, ores, scrap iron. Complete vessel-load lots
-	Liquid bulk: petroleum carried by owned or leased tankers
-	Parcel tankers: 50+ liquids
-	Dry cargo ships (automobile carriers): up to 8500 CEUs (car equivalent)
-	River barges: heavy bulk cargo
China passenger trains have priority over freight
Factors impacting international logistics
-	Selling complementary products together
-	Proliferation of alternative options for carriers
-	Common presence of substitute products
Substitutability: when a buyer can purchase similar products from different suppliers. 
-	Reduce stockouts
-	Slightly more carrying costs
Demand elasticity = % change in quantity / % change in price
Transportation demand is inelastic
Five components that impact demand
-	Capabilities of the carrier must match freight requirements
-	Time in transit: between manufacturing and stocking, releases working capital and reduces inventory costs
-	Reliability of transit times: stockout costs can be minimized
-	Direct service: can reduce cost, time in transit and improve reliability due to not using a partner carrier
-	Carrier’s record
Market structure impact on pricing:
-	Late 1880s: government began regulating transportation business practices
-	Deregulated during mid-1970 through the 90’s
Deregulated market structures:
-	Open competition: large unrestricted entry
-	Oligopoly: several large sellers of the same services
-	Monopoly: one provider with no competitors
-	Competitive monopoly: several small competitive companies, 1 large one dominating lane or service
Pricing strategies:
-	Cost of service pricing: prices determined by using the average or marginal costs
-	Value of service: profit-maximizing approach, carriers charge based on the product’s demand traits
International trade theories
-	Absolute advantage: cheaper to trade than to do it yourself
-	Comparative advantage: better to trade if marginal AND opportunity cost is lower
-	Heckscher-Ohlin Factor endowment theory: country will have a comparative advantage due to one of four factors: labor, capital, land, or entrepreneurship
-	International product life cycle
o	Designed to satisfy market need in a developed country
o	Product is exported to more countries after 1st country
o	Demand increases, imitations begin
o	Focus shifts to lowered products costs
-	Cluster theory: competitive advantage can be gained when close to suppliers and competitors

Import license: importing country’s government document that provides an importer with the express authorization to import a particular product

Certificate of insurance: required under some terms of trade and attests that a particular shipment has insurance coverage

Carnet: temporary admission for passing through a country rather than being imported into it

Export Documentation

Shipper’s export declaration (SED): export/import document prepared by the shipper before the shipment can be exported and presented to a government authority of the country. Specifies value, weight, destination

EEI (the export declaration) was introduced in 2014 to streamline processes

Declaration for free entry of returned products: if good has value added prior to its return, duty may be due on either the fair market value of the labor that was added or the item itself

Export license: document received from a governmental agency authorizing a certain quantity of an export to be sent to a given country.

International Transportation Documents

US Export Administration Regulations requires a “Destination control statement” be included on the invoice, bill of lading, air waybill or other export control document

International bill of lading: bill of lading used in international trade to help ensure exports are paid and imports receive the promised goods

-	Acts as a contract between the shipper and the transportation carrier to transport and deliver goods
-	Signature of the carrier is the shipper’s proof that the carrier received the goods
-	Signature of the consignee at delivery serves as a receipt for the goods
-	B/L is the basis for filing freight claims

Ocean bill of lading: contract between an ocean carrier and a shipper arranging for carriage of freight. Shipper is responsible for all losses other than negligence on the part of the ocean carrier

Through bill of lading (intermodal): allows a carrier to transport goods both domestically and across international borders. Issued when a single shipment travels to its destination by more than one mode of transport or by more than one truck, railcar, ship, or aircraft

Uniform bill of lading: products are being transported on trucks and trains, domestically and internationally. Considered non-negotiable like straight BOLs


Two forms of B/Ls related to the quality of the goods shipped can be issued by the receiver after a thorough inspection:

-	Clean bill of lading, which indicates goods were in good condition
-	Claused (soiled or foul) bill of lading, which indicates that the products transported were damaged in some manner

Waybills

-	Air Waybill (AWB): bill of lading for transporting domestic or international freight by air
-	Road waybill (standard truckload BOL)
-	Rail waybill

Packing list: list showing merchandise packed, a copy of which is sent to the consignee to help verify the shipment

b.	If there are problems, load can be held until corrected, exported or destroyed
4.	Customs determines classification and corresponding duties owned on goods based on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. When the duty is paid, shipment is “liquidated”
5.	Customs releases goods to importer, who coordinates the last leg of the journey
a.	If importer wants to postpone duty payment, goods may be stored in customs bonded warehouse for up to 5 years or brought to FTZ

Customs brokers:licensed firms or individuals by customs that facilitate clearance

Duty: tax levied by a government on the importation, exportation, or use and consumption of goods. Based on:
-	Type of goods being imported, classified according to the harmonized system of classification
-	Value of goods imported, based on invoice
-	Value of any “duty assist” given by the importer to the manufacturer (importer provides the tooling needed to produce the product)
-	The country from which the products are imported

Harmonized system classification codes: internationally standardized description of goods that uses a system of numbers to provide increasingly detailed classifications and descriptions
-	98% of world trade recognizes this system
-	Up to 10 digits
-	First 6 - root
-	Last 4 - country specific subcategories

Harmonized Tariff Schedule: US International Trade Commission’s mechanism by which international tariffs are standardized. Importers and exporters classify goods moved across international borders.

Valuation: goods being shipped determines a variety of other charges and tariffs. 
-	Landed value: 
-	Cost of packaging
-	Transportation in the exporting country
-	International transportation to the destination

*Incoterms® 2010 recommend explicitly stating who will pay for the insurance in a contract or quote. Incoterms® trade terms indicate where risk/liability is transferred but do not actually obligate the buyer or seller to carry insurance except when explicitly noted in the term. In most cases, companies will maintain cargo insurance as a backup.


Incoterms definitions (all modes):
-	Ex Works (EWX): buyer pays all transportation costs and bears all risks for transporting the goods to their destination
-	Free Carrier (FCA): seller delivers goods into the carrier’s custody. Risk passes from seller to buyer. Buyer pays for transportation from the place named in incoterm. Seller is responsible for correcting and paying for any problems or costs of clearing customs
-	Carriage Paid To (CPT): seller pays for the freight to the named point of destination. The passing of risk occurs when the goods have been delivered into the custody of the first carrier
-	Carriage and insurance paid to (CIP): passing of risk occurs when the goods have been delivered into the custody of the first carrier. From this point, buyer bears all risk and any additional costs. Seller pays for insurance and is required to clear the goods for export
-	Delivered at Terminal (DAT): seller delivers the goods at a named terminal or destination. If possible, both parties should try to agree at which point risk is transferred. 
-	Delivered at Place (DAP): Seller delivers the goods to the buyer, who assumes responsibility for their unloading at a named destination.
-	Delivered Duty Paid (DDP): seller pays for all transportation costs, bears all risk until goods have been delivered, and pays for the duty

Incoterms for sea and inland waterway transport:
-	Free Alongside Ship (FAS): seller pays for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment. Buyer pays loading costs, freight, insurance, unloading costs, and transportation to the port of destination. Risk is passed once goods are delivered to pier at the port of shipment
-	Free on Board (FOB): only used for ocean shipping. Better for bulk, break-bulk cargo, or roll on roll off cargo. Responsibility shifts when freight is on vessel. Exporters pay for packaging, shipping to the port of departure, stevedore loading costs, customs clearing, and exporting country pre-shipment inspection. Importer pays for ocean carrier costs, inbound customs costs.
-	Cost of Freight (CFR): seller pays for costs and freight of the goods to the destination port. Buyer pays for the insurance and transportation from the port of discharge (POD). Risk of loss shifts when the goods are on board at the port of shipment. CFR is not used for air or land transport. 
-	Cost, insurance and Freight (CIF): selling price includes the cost of the goods, freight or transport costs, and marine insurance. Under CIF, seller must obtain in transferable for a marine insurance policy to cover the risks of transit. Seller’s responsibility ends when the goods have been delivered on board the shipping vessel at the port of shipment. If seller wants to end responsibility to end when goods are delivered into the hands of a carrier prior to the goods passing the ship’s rail.

Methods of Payment

Cash in advance: payment by the importer to the exporter before the exporter ships the goods, providing the maximum protection to the exporter and no protection to the importer.

Letters of credit: formal letter in which a bank assures the seller that the buyer is good for the purchase price of the foods and that the bank will therefore honor the buyer’s checks to the seller up to that amount.
-	Revocable: pro forma document used to prepare an irrevocable letter of credit
-	Irrevocable: type cannot be canceled by the issues bank unless the exporter agrees to that decision
-	Confirmed irrevocable: foreign bank provides the letter of credit. Guaranteed by a bank in the exporter’s country and is therefore more expensive

Letter of Credit process:
1.	L/C issued. After agreeing to the terms of sale, the buyer/importer goes to its bank and gets a letter of credit demonstrating that the bank has faith in the buyer’s/importer’s ability to pay the purchase price
2.	Buyer’s bank notifies the seller’s bank that the L/C has been issued. Assures the seller’s bank that it can honor drafts from the seller up to the amount of the purchase price. Locks in currency rate.
3.	Seller ships the cargo.
4.	Seller asks its banker for money
5.	Seller’s bank asks buyer’s banker for money
6.	Buyer’s bank waits for cargo (perhaps)
7.	Everyone gets paid

Bill of exchange payment: promissory note that the importer uses to formally acknowledge its debt to the exporter
-	Types of drafts
-	Date: 30, 60, 90 days after date of shipment
-	Time: 30, 60, 90 days after importer signs the draft
-	Sight: seller retains title of the goods until the goods until the importer makes the payment and then receive the bill of lading or air waybill
Open Account (high risk to seller)

Open account payment: method of payment for goods shipped in advance of payment, in which the buyer or importer sends the seller or exporter an invoice requesting payment by a certain date

Exporter sends an invoice to the importer once the products have shipped:

-	Payment due dates
-	Number of days at which importer will be considered past due
-	Interest rate charges on late payments
-	Discounts for early payment(s)
-	Cost of risk insurance

Currency and Tax Considerations

Three options for currency:
-	Convertibility: ease at which one currency can be converted into another.
-	Risk of fluctuation

Reducing transaction explode through hedging

-	Forward market hedge: exporter would purchase the necessary currency to over the foreign payable based on difference in the exchange rates of the two countries
-	Money market hedging: firm protecting its exposure (exporter/seller) will borrow money from a bank in the importer’s country that is an amount equal to the present value of the pay for goods sold.

Transfer pricing: selling a product to another division of the company, usually at market rate “arm’s-length customer” which is straight-forward
-	Selling intracompany goods to subsidiary in lower-tax country is highly regulated, known as base erosion and profit shifting
-	Companies often sell to free trade zones


Foreign/free trade zone (FTZ): designated area within a country that is outside the country. Material is not subject to duties and taxes until material is moved out. 
-	Encourages exports
-	Useful if rates on tariffs are higher than the rates on final products
-	Re-exported materials owe no duties
-	Customs duties and federal excise taxes on imports are deferred
-	Foreign and domestic goods that are to be exported are exempt from state and local inventory taxes
-	Merchandise can be held at the FTZ indefinitely 
-	Goods can be inspected and tested before paying import duties
Companies that have FTZs: Caterpillar, BMW, Ryder Group, GE, Kawasaki Motors













 
 





	































































































































            

**Module 1: Logistics Overview and Strategy**

**Section A Definitions**

Order-to-delivery cycle: period of time when customer places an order and when customer receives the order

Logistics = Materials management + Distribution

Inbound logistics functions: demand forecasting, purchasing, production planning, manufacturing inventory, raw materials and subassembly warehousing, materials handling.

Outbound logistics: finished goods/DC warehousing, finished goods inventory, materials handling, industrial packaging, distribution requirements planning, order processing, transportation, customer management

Systems concept emphasizes whole system vs individual parts

Total cost concept: all decision should favor a total reduction in cost, not just individual parts

Logistics costs: local delivery, primary transport, DC storage costs, inventory carrying, information system costs

Line haul: terminal to terminal

DC storage costs: economies of scale achieved with larger DCs

Inventory carrying costs: capital (physical inventory + financing + opportunity cost), storage (space + personnel + equipment), risk (insurance, pilferage, inventory deterioration, damage, obsolescence)

Make-to-order: goods made after order receipt

Make-to-stock: products finished before receipt, production orders replenish stock

Assemble-to-order: assembled after order receipt, useful when there are common components

Suboptimization: Too narrow of a solution

Warehouse tradeoffs: #, how much inventory, full or selected assortments, size, layout and location relative to suppliers and customers

Inventory management: who controls re-ordering, how to reorder, verify accuracy of inventory levels

Import/export: customs expertise, local vs outsourced

Packaging: reusable or sustainable

Demand forecasting: early = less accurate, later = more accurate, less time to action

Purchasing: supplier distance, order size affects mode

Production planning: type of order (make to stock, etc)

Materials: efficient order picking must be considered, flow of warehouse

Order management: speeding up process can lower transportation costs

Logistics information systems: more information = less inventory

Customer management: balancing service levels and expectations, short lead times = more variability and cost

Four P’s: Product, price, place, promotion

Product: size, weight, density, dimensions, packaging, displays

Price: too high = less sales, too low = less profit margins

Place: distribution channels, where to meet demand

Promotion: push = orderly demand from wholesalers, pull = less predictable (DTC)

Echelon: supply chain node (retailer, DC, supplier, etc)

SKU: stock keeping unit

Time utility: deliver not too early or late

Place utility: desired customer location

Possession utility: advertising SKUs and promoting desirability

Form utility: changing form of good through production process (break-bulking and mixing)

Quantity utility: right qty delivered, error free, matches demand

Information utility: ability of customer to communicate requirements

Service utility: customer receives right post-sale support via desired communication channel

Network design: responsive, agile, least amount of inventory, nearness to suppliers and customers, types of distribution channels

Inventory: maximize turnover (velocity)

Order processing: correct information, resolution of payment issues

Transportation: cost vs service level, type of carrier, minimum service levels

Warehousing, materials handling, packaging: manages equipment, labor and space

Drivers of logistics: cost vs customer service, needs, schedule compression, globalization, market trends, competition, complexity/risk, technology, triple bottom line, regulations/compliance, extreme weather and network failure

Home delivery implications: showcasing (shopping between retailers), night time deliveries decrease vehicle utilization, increased demand for parcel services, order picking has increased time and cost, high return % for online orders, grocery deliveries require temp control

Schedule compression: shortened product life cycles, increased focus to minimize inventory

Globalization: sourcing local vs international affects execution and costs

**Section B Definitions: The Role, Value and Cost of Logistics**

Supply chain management = suppliers + logistics + customers

Stages of maturity

1.  Baseline: internal silos hinder integration, inventory buffers, handoffs, external relationships are transactional, logistics seen as cost center with poor cost control
2.  Functional integration: internal processes are integrated, buffer inventories still exist. Improvements and decisions are seperate.
3.  Internal Integration: logistics is integrated, elimites buffer inventories except for raw materials and finished goods.
4.  External integration: inventory is minimized with information, demand generation and fulfillment are integrated

Channel master: partner with the most power in relationships that creates trends

Comparative advantage: country A can produce more units than country B

Economic impact of logistics: countries that invest in infrastructure see lower transportation costs as % of GDP

Landed cost: product + warehousing + transportation + handling fees. Sourcing closer to demand can assist with lowering it.

Law of squares (Lardner’s law): any reduction in transportation cost will be directly proportional to the increase in the market area where product can be sold competitively. EX: cutting costs in half, doubles the radius you can serve.

Increase inventory turnover = increase economic value of logistics

Average inventory = units sold / cycle time + safety stock. EX: 100/units per day, 10 day cycle time = 1,000 units. Divide by 2 = 500 average inventory. If cycle time is reduced from 10 to 5, 500 units / 2 = 250 average inventory.

Reducing cycle time from 104 to 61 days would save $30 billion in the grocery industry.

Impacts of globalization:

- Higher customer expectations - ecommerce

- Exports of finished goods vs subassembly components increasing

- Larger containerships

- Countries now have low cost, highly skilled labor

- Reduced trade barriers

- EU’s deregulation increases transit times

- 3PL technology improving

Challenges:

- Tariffs/regulations of different countries lead to more time/expertise/costs

- Cultural differences hinder trade agreements

- Bribery

- Terrorism

- Infrastructure poor in some areas

E-commerce: increased D2C sales via internet, increased final mile carrier capacity, 3PLs under pressure = less logistics players in market

Topic 2: The Value of Logistics Management

Logistics manager duties

- Clearly explaining desired end result

- Trusting person to do the work independently

- Challenge status quo

Leadership

- Trait model - charisma, passion and decisiveness. Drawback is that the candidate may be less technical.

- Process-based model - recognizing issues/problems, assemble right team, supporting collaboration, and gathering feedback. May not challenge status quo

Logistics competitive advantages

- reduce cost of transportation, labor and inventory

- improve customer service levels while maintaining profitability

- It’s cohesive bond between sales, procurement and production

How to create a competitive advantage:

- Efficiency - lowest cost provider of logistics to compete on price through high asset utilization, high inventory turnover, minimal inventory. Automated workflows exist too

- Agility - able to scale based on demand signals

- Resilience - withstand disruptions through diversification

- Customer focus - aims to have best in class service levels: perfect order fulfillment, satisfaction, post-sale support

- Responsiveness

- Quality

- Experience

- Complexity competence - import/export terms

Promoting efficiency: level production despite demand peaks. Can be accommodated by:

- Extra warehousing capacity

- Produce goods in peak demand in opposite season

- Produce goods with steady demand year round

- Contract warehousing to flex capacity

- Rent warehouse space to organization with opposite demand profile

Reducing costs

- Reducing costs creates more leverage than increasing revenues

- EX: $10 item

- $6/unit (variable)

- $300,000 (fixed)

- Selling 100,000 units = $1,000,000 revenue - $600,000 variable costs - $300,000 fixed = $100,000 profit

- 10% increase in sales (110,000 units) = $1,100,000 revenue and $660,000 variable costs - $300,000 fixed = $140,000 profit

- Reduction of 10% in variable cost = 100,000 units, $1,000,000 revenue, $540,000 variable costs, $300,000 fixed = $160,000 profit (60% increase

- Factors

- Supplier locations

- Inventory locations relative to demand

- Transportation bids

- Human resources

- Information systems

- Inventory carrying cost

- Turnover

Increasing Customer Satisfaction and Service Levels

- Continuous improvement

- Adjust logistics cost and service to customer

Topic 3: Logistics Costing

Traditional accounting obscures the impact of inventory and transportation - two largest sources of logistics costs

Inbound = included in COGS

Outbound = operating expense, not included in gross profit figure, shipment pricing can be bundled together, which obscures expenses

Fixed cost = Expenditure that does not vary with production volume: rent, property tax, salaries

Variable cost = changes directly with one unit of production

- Direct cost = variable costs associated with job or operation

Indirect cost = costs not directly incurred by an operation, such as plant heating

Direct material = material that becomes part of final product in measurable quantities

Direct labor = Labor applied to good being manufactured or used in the performance of a service

Contribution margin = sales revenue - variable costs

Contribution = sales price - variable costs

Variable cost of goods sold = direct materials, direct labor, supplies

Variable direct cost

- Discounts and promotions

- Sales bonuses and commissions

- Variable customer management costs

- Other volume-based selling and admin expenses

Variable gross profit - variable direct cost = contribution margin

Opportunity cost = return on capital that could have resulted if capital had been used somewhere else

Net profit approach = determines net profit of each element (does not effectively measure logistics costs)

- Example:

Activity based costing = costs driven by activities that consume resources

Direct costs = in ABC, a cost that can be tracked, like units produced, production line, department or manufacturing plant

Tracing = connecting resources to activities to cost objects

Cost object = anything for which a separate cost measurement is desirable. Product, customer, project, or other work unit

Driver = operation that influences the quality of work and cost

Examples of drivers:

- Warehousing - pallet bays used, hours consumed

- Palletized: qty of cartons

- Put-away: cubic volume

- Order picking: qtys, number of visits to pick location, number of lines

- Supervision: supervisor hours

- Transportation: number of deliveries and distance traveled

How to determine cost rates: 

- Classify activities

- Estimate cost of each activity

- Determine unit rate per pick (salary of pickers / units picked)

Throughput accounting = because every system has a constraint that limits global performance, impact can be measured in context of global measures

- Used to expense logistics equipment

Theory of constraints accounting = throughput, inventory and operating expense

Net profit = (sales revenue - true variable costs) - operating expenses

- Net profit = throughput - operating expenses

**Section B Quiz**

Question 1

How did shift from logistics to supply chain affect how inventory is perceived? Shifted towards it becoming a strategic decoupling point - improve information flow, match demand

Question 2

What role was added on to logistics as supply chain management evolved? Externally integrated information systems

Question 3

What is the disadvantage of local deliveries + local production (high costs) vs sourcing in a low labor region?

Competitors will have a cost advantage globally

Question 4

Activity based costing

Type A - $.30 per pick, 5000 units

Type B - $.40 per pick, 3000 units

Type C - $.50 per pick, 1000 units

What percent of costs is in type C?

5000*.30 + 3000*.40 + 1000 *.5 = 3200

Type C (500) / 3200 = .15625 = 15.6%

Question 5

What is a leading indicator of a low-labor country not remaining? Economic success on a macro level

Question 6

What is a market pressure on 3PLs that move TL and LTL? Direct to consumer trends threaten model

Question 7

If an organization wants to be customer focused, what should it do?

Be different things for different customers

Question 8

Company is deciding whether or not to invest in a new fleet. If operating at full capacity, revenue would increase from 200,000 to 300,000 per month. If drivers need to make fewer runs and will idle 10% of the time, what amount of revenue should be used for calculation?

300,000 * .10 = 30,000

300,000 - 30,000 = $270,000

Question 9

Why are traditional accounting methods less useful for logistics costing?

Insurance costs for inventory are grouped with other types of insurance.

Question 10

Why use activity based costing? (per unit measured)

Fairer way to distribute costs among customers

Question 11

What is a good option if high fuel costs are making a products landed cost higher than the price consumers are willing to pay?

Move operations to a location closer to demand

Question 12

What needs to be leverage in order to gain true benefits of supply chain management?

Logistical networks of customers and suppliers - prevents duplicating efforts

Question 13

What is a primary factor that can result in higher logistics costs as a percentage of gross domestic product?

Aggregate inventory levels

Question 14

What is a factor that would require having higher levels of customer service in logistics vs other industries?

Highly substitutable goods - backorders lead to lost sales in competitive environment

Question 15

What is a key leadership skill that can be learned?

Ability to admit mistakes

Question 16

How would a company that uses near sourcing to reduce logistics costs could break into distance markets?

Near-source separately in each key market

Question 17

What receives stronger emphasis in supply chain management than in logistics?

Strategic planning

Question 18

What action by a logistics manager would empower his or her employees?

Have employees participate in setting performance targets

Question 19

Source closer to the point of demand

Question 20

What is the most effective way to increase an organization’s profits?

Reduce transportation costs by 10%

Question 21

What is a good way to increase the profitable service area for a DC?

Decrease transportation costs to the DC

Question 22

Company A - contribution margin: $500,000, fixed costs: $150,000

Company B - contribution margin: $300,000, fixed costs: $80,000, indirect costs: $200,000

If customer B was dropped, what would be change to **net profit?**

Company A contribution margin: $500,000 - $150,000 = $350,000

Company B contribution margin: $300,00 - $80,000 = $220,000

$350,000 + $220,000 = $570,000 - fixed indirect costs of $200,00 = $370,000

Customer B $350,000 - fixed indirect costs of $200,000 = $150,000. $370,000 - $150,000 = $220,000 drop in profits.

Need to know **net profit.**

Question 23

Warehouse at $200,000 in fixed costs. $10/unit in variable costs. Half of the costs direct/indirect. 5,000 pallets in storage, what is cost per pallet?

$20,000 / 5,000 pallets = $40 per pallet + $10 per pallet = $50 per pallet

Strategic plan = mission, goals, objectives, and actions needed to achieve

Logistics strategies

- Generic

- Cost leadership

- Differentiation

- Focus

- Customer service

- Group by segment

- Bowersox / Daughtery

- Process - reduce cost through lean

- Market - reduce complexity

- Information - share info to increase cohesion and external partner collaboration

Example goals to increase return on capital:

- Order-to-delivery cycle of 10 days or less

- Fulfillment lead time of 3 days or less

- Inventory days of supply of 15 days of less

Objectives

- Network integration - information that drives inventory strategy, transportation service requirements, network design, # of DCs, automation

- Inventory

- Levels - nonproductive inventory

- Turnover

- Transportation - mode selection to minimize cost, short local deliveries, effective use of 3PLs

- Variance reduction - provides shorter order cycle time, lower safety stock

- Agility - how to scale capacity

- Product life cycle support / reverse logistics - introduction, growth, maturity, decline, returns, recalls and recycling. Returns are a huge drain on profit

- Quality - Damage, incorrect deliveriest

- Customer service and responsiveness

Topic 3: cost and service optimization

- Availability

- Operational performance

- Service reliability

Innovative thinking

- Shipment consolidators

- Delaying shipments to consolidate orders (accepting long lead times and higher inventory)

- Partnerships with others with same origin-destination pairings

- Long-term contracts with package services to control cost

Dwell: duration of time between cargo arrives in a terminal’s in-transit storage and when it is shipped by clearance transportation

Systems Perspective

- Represented as a diagram:

o Airport

o Seaport

o Warehouse

o Market

o Plant

- Links connect nodes

Total cost of ownership: sum of all costs associated with every activity of the supply stream:

- Purchase cost – price per unit from suppliers

- Production cost – cost per unit of direct materials, direct labor, and factory overheard

- Landed cost - product + warehousing + transportation + handling fees

- Monitoring/control costs

Items typically omitted from TCO:

- Financing and opportunity costs

- Sales and marketing

- Administrative

- Reverse logistics

- Insurance and risk management

- Taxes / foreign exchange

Post-transaction costs (might be included in TCO):

- Requirements for research

- Product development

- Contract sourcing

- Plant opening/closings

- Hiring/layoffs

- Supplier education

- System integration

Ongoing costs of TCO

- Life cycle – quality, durability, maintainability vs price

- Costs of quality – defects, repairs, rework, returns, warranties

- Sustainability costs – recycling, recovery of materials

- Customer service and reputation costs (support, lost customers)

Total cost minimization

- Simplified model - # of DC points and transportation costs

- Companies often ignore effects of long lead times and associated carrying costs

o EX: Sourcing copper in Brazil, South Korea, China and US is cheapest in China, but the short lead times in US had the lowest costs.

Make or buy cost analysis: deciding to produce an item internally or buy from outside supplier. Factors: costs, capacity, proprietary, knowledge, quality considerations, skill requirements, volume, and timing.

Outsourcing: process of having suppliers provide goods and services that were previously provided internally.

Insourcing: using firm’s resources to provide goods or services

Subcontracting: sending production work outside to another manufacturer

Make-or-buy considerations:

- Core competency?

- Consequences of lost skills and knowledge?

- Landed cost or TCO?

- What is the break-even point?

Core competency: skills or knowledge sets that provide greatest level to its customers that is difficult to outsource or subcontract out

Consequences of lost skills and knowledge: many companies insource many functions because outsourcing is risky due to less control of customer experience.

Landed cost or TCO, factors to consider:

- Control – quality, processes, sustainability

- Customer focus and responsiveness

- Risk management – risk of IP theft, litigation, damage to reputation

Offshore outsourcing case study (TCO): 70% reduction in labor costs, increased transportation costs of 20%, increased monitoring and control costs of 20$ = net reduction in costs of 30%

TCO factors favoring a buy decision:

- Agility – respond to demand

- Resilience

- Reduced capital expenditures

- Better focus on core competencies

- New ideas

- Access to new markets

- Expertise and complexity management

Break-even analysis: study of number of units or time to recoup an investment

- EX:

o Plant costs $10 million, Variable cost = $25/unit

o Buy from vendor = $0 fixed costs, $35 in variable costs

o $35-25 = $10/unit

o $10,000,000 / $10/unit = 1,000,000 units to break even

- If demand > 1,000,000 = make

- If demand < 1,000,000 = buy

Topic 4: contracting and budgeting

Steps in contracting process

1.  Begin with goal in mind and document plans
2.  Analyze strategic imperatives – core competencies
3.  Analyze costs of current state
4.  Select providers

1.  Define requirements
2.  Identify type
3.  Locate and research potential providers
4.  Request RFP
5.  Evaluate and compare responses
6.  Select a contractor and negotiate
7.  Finalize contract

6.  Implement contract
7.  Reorganize internal process and transition staff
8.  Manage contract relationships

1.  Develop strategic, tactical and operational goals
2.  Feedback channels
3.  Measure performance in both directions
4.  Improve service through continuous improvement

Budgeting methods

- Static – based on expected demand and capacity level

- Flexible budget (expense) – dynamically adjusts to changes in sales and demand for logistics services

- Rolling budget – Budget that is revised every 12 to 18 months

Important budgets for logistics

- Capital – determines long-term funding for projects (build property, plant, software)

- Logistics operating budget – determines necessary expenditures to deliver service level.

- Cash budget – control timing of cash flows

Budgeting process:

1.  Set objectives and policies
2.  Analyze capacity and resources in a gap analysis
3.  Update and clearly communicate parameters
4.  Coordinate and review sub budget development
5.  Get final budget approval
6.  Distribute and communicate the importance of the budget

Setting goals – minimum, expected, or likely and stretch (motivates continuous improvement)

Cash budget:

- Cash receipts (actual inflows)

- Cash disbursements (outflows)

- Cash surplus or deficit

- Financing – borrowings or repayments to cover deficits

Customer segmentation

- Least profitable business sectors = minimum level of service

- Delivery channel

- Product – mode of transportation, warehousing

o Bulk materials – liquids, grains

o Size and shape – pallet or floor loaded

o Temperature – type of truck

o Value – insurance, mode, risk

o Variety – risk of high inventory

o Hazardous goods – compliance, insurance

o Cross-contamination – segregate chemicals, etc

Product life cycles

1.  Development – research, design, testing, finalization, specs (for unit load sizes and costs)
2.  Introduction – high cost with low sales = negative profits
3.  Growth – sales increase, distribution expands, make to stock begins, 3PL warehousing needed, risk of too much inventory of demand signal inaccurate
4.  Maturity – most profitable, sales increase but slower
5.  Decline – market is saturated, declining demand, declining production, transition to make to order strategy to avoid excessive inventory

Life cycles and suppliers

- Regulations require tracing materials back to their source

- Establish way to handle returns and communicate improvements

- Suppliers with shorter part life cycles than product can limit supply

Reverse logistics

- Warranties

- Space parts

- Returns

**Section D: Logistics Framework Notes**

Types of organizational structures:

- Functional structure with no logistics functional area – series of grain silos, where there is suboptimization and slow transfer of information.

- Functional structure with logistics functional area – other departments have no say in managing logistics. High cooperation is required.

- Matrix – Director + supply chain + logistics

- Network – Process focused, from order receipt to delivery. Agile and reliant on information sharing.

Centralized (organized, shipping volume discounts) vs decentralized (more responsive to customer)

Echelon: levels of supply chain nodes, focused on warehousing. Good for wide arrays of products

Direct: minimal warehouse #, inventory, direct shipping to demand.

Combined: uses both echelons and direct. Fast moving items are sent to echelons (close to customers) and slow-moving items are at centralized warehouse for direct delivery.

Flexible: Allow warehouse to communicate and share workloads.

 Examples:

- Ship a back order from a more distant warehouse.

- Customer is equidistant from two warehouse, ship from highest inventory or capacity to balance workload.

- Stock a master facility with a full line of products, support smaller warehouses with limited inventory.

- Cross-docking: Time orders from manufacturers to align outbound orders

- Integrated service providers: can hold slow moving inventory, consolidation

Logistics relationships:

- Contract: End date with no guarantee with penalties and termination causes

- Ongoing relationship: contract, but with more information sharing and goals.

- Leader/follower: supply chain integration started by channel master

- Strategic alliance: integration through joint investments that increases performance of all companies involved.

- Enterprise extension: parties integrate processes, cultures, and information

Factors

- Trust

- Leadership

- Power

- Risk

- Information sharing and visibility

Types of collaboration:

- Horizontal: suppliers share retailers so they share a warehouse

- Quick response: JIT replenishment with high turnover from high changeovers. Fast transportation used.

- Efficient: smooth flow between manufacturers and retailers, minimizes inventory using cross-docking, vendor-managed inventory

- Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment

o Strategy and planning: product mixes

o Demand and supply management: forecast demand data and replenish together

o Execution: order fulfillment and monitoring KPIs

o Vendor-managed inventory (VMI): gives manufacturer responsibility for restocking its products, reduces bullwhip effect, more information on retail demand

Topic 3: Strategic Risk management

Supply chain risk: variety of possible events that can affect goods, services, funds or information resulting in quantitative or qualitative loss.

Risks

- Tolerant vs averse to risk – set at organization strategy level

- Demand

o Low demand

o Lower price than expected

- Supply

o Cost of material + labor higher than expected

o Recalls or strikes

o External relationships do not deliver promises or have unethical behavior.

- Process

o Service failures or capacity constraints

o Dysfunctional internal structures – silos, adversarial cultures, disjointed information systems

o Failure to communicate strategic plans or demand data due to oversight or mistrust.

- Financial risk

o Your org or partner could experience financial failure

o Currency exchange, the economy or credit availability

- Environmental

o Supply chain disruptions – disasters, war, or terrorism

o Government regulations, interference, failure to invest in infrastructure, or instability.

Strategy opportunities and risks

Lean

- Opportunities: less waste and buffer inventory

- Risks: more stockouts or line stoppage after disruption

Few suppliers:

- Opportunities: economies of scale

- Risks: increases supply risk due to disaster or financial failure, quality recalls would result in widespread issues, replacing suppliers takes time

Low-count country sourcing

- Opportunities: low labor costs

- Risks: long lead times, IP theft, government appropriation

Contracting

- Opportunities: focus on core competencies and cut costs

- Risks: operations less visible, harder to coordinate

Supply chain security

- Warehouse pilferage: No exceptions to warehouse yard access. Single gate. Rotate assignments. Audit case counts.

- Truck hijacking: Instruct staff to hand over keys, avoid high-risk routes, technology

- Damage: Pallet-stacking limits, separate items in loads to prevent cross-contamination, proper packaging

Compliance

- Customs regulations: classify goods properly, paying fair value, correct markings and labeling. Import/export regulations exist to collect taxes, ban illegal or substandard and prevent trade dumping.

- Prohibited goods: Limited for import/export between countries due to national interest or security concerns

- Country of origin tracking: Regulations that help orgs qualify for beneficial product labeling (“Made in…” and trade agreement tax discounts

- Air freight regulations: regulated by the international air transport association (IATA) and the international civil aviation organization (ICAO). Countries can restrict # of flights.

- Trucking regulations: limit noise at night, driver time, ban trucks in certain areas

- Rail regulations: rates, services issues, line sales, mergers and acquisitions, line abandonments, classifications, facilities, interchange traffic among carriers---- regulated by the Surface Transportation Board.

- Safety Regulations:

o FMCSA – motor carriers

o US Coast guard – maritime safety

o States – highways, traffic laws

o Federal – Vehicle weight and trailer length

- Anti-terrorism: Additional screening is needed, though partnerships like the Authorized Economic Operator program make it easier to cross

Social mandates

- Voluntary initiatives

- Consumer pressure – labor, environmental protections, treatment of local populations

Strategic risk tools

- Identifying and managing exceptions

o Determine gaps between desired and actual strategy

▪ Internal - from change in business direction, merger or acquisition, internal resistance, complexity due to cultural differences

▪ External – disruptive technology, change in market, faster change in product’s life cycle

o How to close gaps

▪ Reward critics for speaking up through anonymous surveys or brainstorming sessions

▪ Assign someone to analyze larger trends

- Limiting complexity

o Outsourcing imports and customs clearance

o Fewer SKUs

SWOT analysis – strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats

- Internal strengths and weaknesses: skill sets, reputation, input from customers and suppliers

- External opportunities and threats: market trends, risk analysis, demographic change, customer needs, competitor pricing and offerings, emerging technology, taxes, laws, regulations

o PESTEL – political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, environmental, and legal

Talent Acquisition and Management

Hierarchy of needs

- Self-actualization – challenging work, growth

- Esteem – reputation, recognition

- Social – belonging

- Safety – work environment, job security, useful benefits

- Physiological needs – earnings, breaks

Survey of priorities

1.  Pay
2.  Challenging work
3.  Work-life balance
4.  Working with a talented team

o Documentation

o Product condition

o POF = total perfect orders / total number of orders

- Order fulfillment cycle time – responsiveness

o Time between customer placing an order and receipt

o Order cycle time = process time + dwell time

o Average order cycle time = sum of actual order times / total

- Upside/downside adaptability, overall value at risk – ability to respond to market changes

o Upside: “Discrete measurement of the quantity of increased production an org can achieve for 30 days

o Downside: “Discrete measurement of the reduction in quantities ordered sustainable at 30 days prior to delivery with no inventory or cost penalties

o Overall value at risk: sum of probability risk events (Plan + Source + Make + Deliver + Return)

- Total supply chain management cost, COGS – cost of operating supply chain

o TSCMC = Sales – profits – cost to serve

▪ (More detailed formula): Plan cost + source cost + make cost + deliver cost + return cost + mitigation costs

▪ Total cost to serve: sum of supply chain cost to deliver products to customers

▪ COGS: accounting classification to determine amount of direct materials, direct labor, allocated overheard

- Cash-to-cash cycle time, return on supply chain fixed assets, return on working capital

o Cash-to-cash cycle time = days sales outstanding + inventory days of supply -days payables outstanding

▪ Days sales outstanding = receivables / annualized revenues * 365

▪ Inventory days of supply = inventory / annual COGS * 365

- 2000 units @ 200 units/day = 10 days of supply

▪ Days payables outstanding = payables / COGS * 365

o Return on fixed assets = return on capital used to plan, source, make, deliver and return (property, plant equipment)

▪ (Supply chain revenue – COGS – Supply chain management costs) / supply chain fixed assets

o Return on working capital – measure of profit on the amount of capital consumed

▪ (Supply chain revenue – COGS – Supply chain management costs) / (inventory + A/R – A/P)

**Section F: Reengineering and Continuous Improvement**

Improving an existing process or system

- Reengineering – involves project management

- Continuous improvement – step by step process to make work more efficient

Business process reengineering (BPR) – procedure that involves rethinking of business


Continuous replenishment – supplier is notified of daily sales to avoid stockouts resulting an improvement in inventory turnover

Demand = predictable, lead time = long --- lean + make-to-stock

Demand = unpredictable, lead time = short --- agile methods

Demand = unpredictable, lead time = long ----agile + lean (leagile) which increases safety stocks

Lean production – minimization of all resources including time

- Eliminate waste

o Design

o Production

o Supply chain management

- Must be adopted by everyone

Just-in-time(JIT)

- Zero inventories

- Short, consistent lead times

- Small and frequent replenishment of inventoryu

- High quality

Forms of waste

- Transportation – excessive movement of people, things or information

- Inventory – Storage of materials prior to demand signal

- Motion – unnecessary handling, walking, driving, bending, lifting, reaching or turning

- Waiting – idle time caused by lack of direction, instructions, information, parts or equipment

- Overproduction – make more than immediately required

- Overprocessing – higher-grade materials or tighter tolerances than required

- Defects – Scrap, rework and erroneous documentation

- Skills – worker underutilization or empowerment beyond capabilities

Japanese terms

- Muda – activities that consume resources but create no customer value

- Mura – demand or activities that are inconsistent or uneven

- Muri – overburdening of works or processes

Push vs pull

- JIT systems want to be pull, not push, though push is often required

- Push 

o Traditional make-to-stock, forecasts are often wrong

- Pull

o Kanban – system of cards to signal demand

o Customer > retailer > suppliers(s)

Agile Supply Chains: ability to respond quickly to unpredictable changes in customer needs by configuring operations. Orgs want to be agile because:

- Demand and product requirements are unstable

- Product lift cycles are short

- Inventory becomes obsolete

- Customer high expectations

Agile systems:

- Require data sharing between echelons

- Minimal finished goods inventory

- Minimal lead times

- Direct factory delivery to customer when possible

- Collaborate production planning

- Light manufacturing or geographic postponement within distribution

Postponement: intentionally delays final production (assembly, production, packaging, tagging) until the latest time in the process to reduce risk

- Light manufacturing – org needs to have sufficient space for good flow through

- Geographic – moves inventory to key DCs but final delivery is triggered by demand

Lean plus agile – long lead times and unpredictable demand

Six sigma – methodology to decrease process variation and improve product quality

- Customer – performance, reliability, competitive price, on-time delivery, excellent service.

- Process – Flowcharting process from outside looking in. reduce errors and variability.

- Employee – offer training at all levels

Sig sigma process and tools

- Define – determine nature

- Measure -existing performance vs data

- Analyze – determine root cause

- Improve – develop solutions

- Control – monitor process until solutions are engrained

Continuous improvement: act of making incremental, regular improvements and upgrades to a process or product

Continuous process improvement: never-ending effort to expose and eliminate root causes of problems

Kaizen: japanese term from improvement

Cost of poor quality: costs associated with performing a task incorrectly and/or generating unacceptable output. These costs would include the cost of noncomformities, inefficient, and lost opportunities

CPI steps:

- Reducing variability in lead times

- Improving a picking route

Plan-do-check-action (PDCA):

1.  Plan
2.  Do
3.  Check
4.  Action

Continuous steps:

1.  Determine the process to be improved
2.  Gather and compile data on the as-is state
3.  Analyze the data and produce a to-be state
4.  Select the best method among alternatives
5.  Implement
6.  Sustain the new method

Continuous objectives

- Improve quality

- Improving productivity

- Eliminating waste

Cost of poor quality: costs associated with doing a task incorrectly, which include nonconformities, inefficient processes and lost opportunities.

Employee involvement: uses experience, creative energy and intelligence by treating them with respect, keeping them informed and including them in decision-making processes.

Employee empowerment: practice of giving non-managerial employees the responsibility and the power to make decisions.

Root cause analysis: ishikawi diagram is a tool to help determine root causes.

Value stream mapping visualizes flow of materials from supplier to customer, including all value and non-value-added time. Reduces waste, decreases flow time, make the process flow more efficient and effective

**Section F Quiz**

Question 1

Which is a lean principle that relies on relinquishing hierarchical authority?

Culture of continuous improvement

Question 2

Which is an objective of lean?

Question 3

What should an org do if 3.4 defects per million opportunities is not feasible and customers do not expect that service level?

Customize goals that are ambitious given what is feasible and customer-accepted.

Question 4

What kind of waste would be easiest to identify by studying the bottom portion of a value stream map?

Waiting

Question 5

Which might be considered a form of waste under lean?

Performing quality control on incoming raw materials

Question 6

Which type of inventory might be relatively higher than normal in an agile system?

Work-in-process - manufacturing postponement

Question 7

Demand is roughly 500,000 and 800,000 units. Profit margins are low. Which solution would improve margins with fewest tradeoffs?

Produce 500,000 units in a low-labor-cost country and ship by ocean; then near-source remaining demand at agile facilities.

Question 8

Logistics professionals have been overburdened with expediting shipments, and this has led to a decrease in perfect orders. Using lean's problem-solving approach to waste, which is the most likely root cause of this issue?

Demand or activities that are inconsistent or uneven (mura)

Question 9

A manufacturing process is labor- and equipment-intensive, down to the final steps. The organization has put all product documentation online so there are no country-specific differences between products. What agile technique can the organization use if it has short lead times but high demand uncertainty?

Geographic postponement

“Geographic postponement moves inventory to key distribution centers (DCs), but forward deployment to the final DC or retail location is postponed until customer orders trigger the movements.”

Question 10

An organization wants to set up a kaizen team to implement a kaizen blitz in order to address inefficiencies and waste in the order management process, since it is adding to an already long lead time. Customer service has been handling complaints, sales wants to expedite orders quite often, and manufacturing and procurement want to be notified of orders sooner. Which is a best practice for this kaizen team?

Keep the team as small as possible, perhaps involving only IT and order management professionals.

Question 11

Which might be part of your job as a logistics professional if your organization adopts lean manufacturing?

Determining an efficient way to customize a logistics service for one customer

Question 12

Under lean and other methods of continuous improvement, which low-level employee action is encouraged?

Proposing experiments that could improve work effectiveness

Question 13

Which would be unacceptable in an organization that has fully embraced lean or a similar continuous improvement philosophy?

Publicly berating an employee for missing a deadline

Question 14

What might be needed in a supply chain that uses "leagile" due to long lead times and highly unpredictable demand?

Safety stock

Question 15

Using six sigma languages, at least how many chances of a defect exist with perfect order fulfillment?

Product: The product ordered is the product provided.

Quantity: The product ordered is provided in the ordered quantity.

Delivery: The location and delivery time ordered are met upon receipt.

Customer order: The product is delivered to the specified entity.

Documentation supporting the order: All documents are accurate, complete, and on time.

Product condition: The product is delivered and faultlessly installed (as applicable) according to

specifications with no damage, is customer-ready, and is accepted by the customer.

Question 16

Which is a tradeoff of pursuing responsiveness that postponement tries to mitigate?

Loss of economies of scale from having shorter production runs

Question 17

An organization has to have long lead times because the goods it sells are low margin and have many competitors. The high competition and high substitutability among brands means that demand is also highly unpredictable. What type of supply chain would be best for this organization?

“Leagile”

Question 18

Which is an example of a lean objective put into practice?

Warehouse pickers wear walking chronometers and compete on fewest steps per line item picked. ----reduces waste

**Retail Compliance**

**Background**

ADX Theriac decided to push these standards out to their U.S.–based ADX stores. ADX Theriac started using an on-time in full (OTIF) policy with monthly compliance targets of 65 percent for all LTL orders and 85 percent for all TL orders starting January 1. Compliance requires an order to arrive (complete) within a two-day window, neither too early nor too late. Reliability Logistics is in charge of ensuring that their portion of the deliveries are in compliance and for enforcing compliance with the suppliers and carriers who make deliveries to their DCs. Failures on the part of Reliability or the carriers and suppliers they work with results in a penalty of 3 percent of the invoice, a cost that is shared with the responsible party.

At the end of the first month, Reliability and its supply chain partners are in compliance with the LTL orders, but TL orders are at 80 percent and are noncompliant. Supply chain and senior leadership meet to address this problem and explore possible solutions or changes in strategy. Several avenues for further exploration are determined:

What information is needed from the retailer, and how can we better partner with ADX Theriac to get better data?

How can we align the supply chain to achieve these goals? The supply chain includes Reliability Logistics’ warehousing, order management, and local delivery, plus third-party carriers used for line-haul transport and the supply chain planning and operations of multiple suppliers.

Are our suppliers’ order fill rates acceptable, or do they need to improve operations?

How can we ensure that any changes we make will actually result in fewer cases of noncompliance?

What is the cost ramification to make these changes, and how does this compare to being charged the 3 percent penalty?

**Questions & Answers**

**When delving into the question of what information is needed from the retailers, what information is likely to be of the most use in reducing the risk of noncompliance?**

Details on the retailers’ rules of trade, for example, how they mark specific deliveries as compliant versus noncompliant

**ADX Theriac wants Reliability Logistics to be capable of just-in-time rapid deliveries, especially for hot new products such as the CBD oils they plan to start aggressively selling. Which is the most viable solution that would also minimize the final price of the product to customers?**

Set cycle stocks of CBD oils at Reliability’s DCs equal to one full order for each retail store served by that DC

**Reliability Logistics decides to look into the CBD oil manufacturer’s recent incomplete order delivery. What is the most important thing to look into from a future retail compliance perspective?**

Whether they have the available manufacturing capacity to meet the required order fill rate

**What sort of change management would serve Reliability Logistics the best to get everyone aligned to this “new world order”?**

Pull together a cross-functional team with expertise from this and other supply chain partners who will craft a cohesive message selling the importance of everyone doing their part.

**The cross-functional team weighs the costs of replacing some logistics information systems to better align with the retailers’ systems and reconfiguring other systems to include retail compliance rules. The team determines that this will cost the equivalent of six months’ worth of penalties. They estimate that if no change is made they will have penalties in half the months of the year. What should the team recommend to senior management?**

Make the change despite the high cost, since accumulating penalties is likely to eventually prompt ADX Theriac to find a new logistics partner.

**Module 2: Logistics Network Design**

Organizations evaluate their DC networks for the following reasons:

- Customers continue to increase expectations

- Mergers and acquisitions require re-engineering

- Freight volumes have shifted: new suppliers, international trade, demand, new product lines.

Topic 2: Methods for entering Global Markets

Variables to consider

- Market strategy

- Type of product being sold

- Life cycle

- Size of market in terms of the dollar values

- Infrastructure, economic climate, culture and trade partners

- Whether the target market is growing or flat

Methods of Global entry

- Exporting

o Agent: Located in the target market area that sells manufacturer’s products according to company’s terms of sales.

o Distributor: buys manufacturer’s products to resell at a profit, unsold inventory is their problem

o Marketing subsidiary: foreign office staffed by exporting firm, where all sales are considered domestic.

o Foreign sales corporation: Using a subsidiary in a pre-approved location where exports can be sent all across the world (US virgin islands, Jamaica, and Barbados)

- Indirect exporting

o Export trading company: ask one of its suppliers or another company making a complementary product

o Export management company: setup in a foreign country, suppliers sell direct to customers

o Piggybacking

- Licensing: paying a fee for permission to manufacture and sell a product created by another

- Direction ownership and production abroad: owning factory vs using existing channel

- Joint ventures: combined investments by companies, may lead to disagreements

Topic 3: Transportation requirements and network size

Business strategy and customer requirements

- EX: 90% of customers getting their goods within 72 hours of order receipt at an average fill rate of 94%

- Adjusting how many and how far warehouses are to demand affects service levels

Steps:

1.  Determine customer requirements and network servicing expectations

1.  Identify customer segments
2.  Min/max service levels
3.  Frequency of orders

3.  Calculate the threshold service level

1.  Cheapest method to serving all customers given transportation cost, safety stock, delivery timing and frequency
2.  Economic cost map visualizes cost breakdown of DC

5.  Use sensitivity analysis to adjust factors one at a time and determine the incremental cost difference of increasing any given factor

1.  Changing one variable to see system change
2.  Cost of safety follows the square root rule

 i. Estimates impact on safety stock of adding/deleting warehouses

3.  Pareto analysis:

4.  Present the alternatives and their cost differences and finalize strategy

1.  Decision of cost of each service level can be determined

Analysis of transportation requirements for the customer

- Driven by demand forecast and demand management activities

- Consider volume of SKUs first

Equation to determine if adding DC is a net benefit (if top is less than or equal to bottom):

Sum(TL transport + TL processing)

/ average( # of TLs) +

 average shipment DC cost + average shipment local delivery

<=

Processing cost of average shipment + direct freight cost of average shipment

Inventory locations and levels, order size and frequency

- Average aggregate inventory = order qty/2 + safety stock + in-transit inventory

- Adding DC locations =

o Stock per DC decreases

o Safety stock will increase

o Faster in-transit days

o Reduced cycle time due to distance to customer

Number of warehouses caused by:

- Globalization requires close inventory to markets

- Competition forces require agility in filing demand (adding cross-docking or consolidation/break-bulk warehouses)

Facility Location decisions: nation, region, local area and site

Modeling Approaches

Model definition: tool with inputs, processes and outputs

- Inputs: variables or data

- Processes: functions performed on the inputs

- Outputs: business information

Heuristics: form of problem solving in which the results have been determined by experience or intuition instead of optimization.

- Forecasting

- Lot sizing

- Determining production

- Staff

- Inventory levels

Cost-volume analysis: compares the fixed + variable costs of locations

Assumptions:

- Fixed costs are constant

- Variable costs are at a steady linear rate

- Only one product is being shipped

Total cost = fixed cost + (variable cost x volume)

Operating leverage: determines at that level break-even is reached

- High leverage = more fixed costs, but more profits per sale. Break-even is slower to achieve.

- Low leverage = High proportion of variable costs, but lower profit per sale. Break-even is easier to achieve.

Examples of operating leverage

- Denver

o Low fixed costs due to low rent

o High variable costs due to longer distances

- Seattle

o Middle level of fixed and variable costs

- Los Angeles

o High fixed costs due to automation

o Low variable costs due to proximity to customers

- Pick a basic risk response

o Accept: take no action

o Avoid: changing a plan to eliminate risk or protect plan objectives

o Transfer: have another party assume the risk

o Mitigate: Reduce exposure to risk in terms of likelihood or impact

- Develop preventative and contingent action plans

- Implement action plans

- Regularly meet to review risk response status

Value at risk (VAR): sum of all of the expected monetary values (EMV). If net sum is positive, then the rewards outweigh the risks. Formula = probability x net monetary impact

International Security measures

Business Continuity Planning: plans to ensure that an organization is capable of continuing to deliver products or services at acceptable predefined levels following disruption.

Business continuity management system (BCMS): establishes, implements, operates, monitors, reviews, maintains and improves an organization’s ability of delivering products or services.

ISO 22301: specifies requirements for setting up and managing an effective continuity management system.

Insurance

Ways to insure against loss:

- Risk transfer to 3rd party (usually insurance company)

- Self-insurance: requires large amount of money, usually large importers who ship low-value goods and can absorb loss

- Mixed approach by setting high deductibles

Cargo insurance: dictated by incoterms, carriers have max liability terms

Commercial property insurance: Facility must be damaged or inaccessible

Business interruption insurance: damage is sufficient to shut down all operations, pays salries, relocation expenses and lost new income

Contingent business interruption insurance: Insured customer or supplier losses provide you with reimbursement for lost profits or other transferred risks.

Trade disruption insurance: insurance for trade disruptions not involving physical asset damage. Property, marine and political risk unrelated to your or your supplier’s assets.Addresses nondelivery, project cancellations, government appropriations. Fills in insurance gaps

Global logistics insurance: Customs bonds, bailee (holders of others’ cargo), consolidator liability, foreign port operator insurance, ship hull insurance. Truck liability

Cyber insurance: IT failures and cybercrime

**Value stream mapping project**

![Diagram
Description automatically generated](file:///C:/Users/Jordan/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image009.jpg)

Note that the local DC on the left and on the right is the same DC. (The vehicles return to their local DC at the end of the milk run.) Note also that the organization has created a number of metrics related to overall vehicle efficiency (not included here for brevity), including metrics for excess driver breaks, excess load time, speed loss, quality delays, clients not served, unscheduled vehicle time, scheduled (and unscheduled) maintenance time, administrative efficiency, and so on.

Here are some key points regarding the “as is” value stream map:

- Drivers help load their vehicles, but this reduces available time for driving.

- Drivers do all of their own unloading at each location.

- The fill loss is 30 percent, meaning that on average there is 30 percent unused available space in vehicles.

- On average, drivers finish their routes with 23 minutes remaining, but this is not enough time to reduce the number of vehicles and drivers.

- Routings provided by corporate do not use dynamic rerouting to deal with traffic issues, but dynamic rerouting software could reduce average route times by 10 percent.

Question 1

How could ADX Wholesale Pharmaceuticals innovate to help implement its parent organization’s strategy to create a reverse supply chain drop zone for customers of online retailers?

Have grocery suppliers deliver to the break-bulk DCs and then include these groceries in local DC deliveries and their milk runs.

Question 2

ADX Wholesale Pharmaceuticals determines that it may be feasible to accept groceries in their current cold chain since they have available warehouse space and the total groceries would occupy about 20 percent of a given vehicle’s cargo space on average. What additional costs would this change create?

It will increase warehouse labor costs and require more time per driver stop.

Question 3

Which is the best way listed to accommodate the larger average amount of time required per driver stop, assuming that all of the options would fix the problem?

Have drivers start their shift with a fully loaded truck and invest in dynamic routing software to reduce the average driving time.

Question 4

On a trial run, a driver did a milk run with pharmaceuticals plus groceries for the subsidiary retail locations. An analyst rode along and timed activities. While the grocery delivery add-on increased average time in a retail store by about 10 minutes, deliveries to non-affiliated doctors and pharmacies make up a significant number of the stops, and these have no grocery deliveries. The average time per stop therefore increased by only five minutes. If the average times to the first retailer, between retailers, and for the return are reduced by 10 percent using dynamic routing software, and the driver starts with a fully loaded truck (which adds 30 minutes to the available time), will this be sufficient to compensate for an extra five minutes per average stop? (Assume that if rounding is needed, planners round toward the more conservative estimate of savings.)

  
Yes, and it will also improve vehicle utilization metrics.

Question 5

What would be another way to improve vehicle utilization that the organization could add to their “to be” version of the value stream map?

Have the driver drop the groceries off, but get the store employees to place them in the cooler whenever someone is available.

**Section: B reverse logistics**

Revese logistics: supply chain dedicatd to the reverse flow of products and materials for the purpose of returns, repair, remanufacture, and/or recycling.

- Manufacturers spend up to 9 to 15% on returns

- Only 20% have a dedicated logistics strategy to effectively manage returns

Reverse supply chain: planning and controlling of the processes of moving goods from the point of consumption back to the point of origin of repair, reclamation, recycling or disposal.

Supplier > manufacturer > distributor > wholesaler > retailer > end user

Returns: step in the process where a customer sends product back: defective, damaged, out of season, outdated, didn’t meet expectations, or represented excess inventory.

Reasons of returns

- Customer changing their mind

- Order entry

- Recalls: defect or hazard, can be a financial obligation

- Overstocks: retailer ordered more than what they can sell

- Obsolete products: nearing the end of their product life cycle

- Packaging: inconsistent marketing of the product itself

Return policies

- Zero returns

- Return rate allowance

- Discount offers

- Accept only defective returns

- Having receivers hold until they have truckload qtys to ensure its economical

- Gatekeeping: returns only happen after speaking to customer service, reduces level of returns

- Executive’s guide to reverse logistics (Greve and Davis)

o Product can be repaired = manufacturer absorbs repair costs

o Not working properly and under warranty = manufacturer pays costs

o Not recalled and not working = customer pays repair costs

- Best practices

o Retailers deduct charges for returned products and processing and freight costs for shipping returned items from the outstanding payables they have with the manufacturer

o Manufacturers do not accept or credit in any way product returns from retailers that do not comply with the terms and conditions of ther sales agreements.

o Defective or recalled products – manufacturer typically pays the freight directly or indirectly

o Leading manuf. Of high tech products are more strict and do not pay handling or consolidation fees

o Secondary market buyers pay for their own transportation carrier

o Product may be shipped using reusable packaging and a return label.

Internal or outsourced reverse logistics?

Internal core competency

- Provide firm with competitive advantage by making returns easier for customers and by promoting its reputation

- Firm can monetize some of its efforts by tracking and documenting its income from various methods of handling returns.

- Increasing demand from customers, shareholders, and governments for products that are recyclable, resuable, and less likely to end up in landfills – viewed as unfriendly.

- Centralizing returns allows for scale and identify returned product versions correctly

Disposition of Returns

![Text
Description automatically generated](file:///C:/Users/Jordan/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image011.gif)

6 ways a return can be handled

1.  Return to stock
2.  Return to manufacturer or producer
3.  Liquidate
4.  Donate
5.  Recycle
6.  Dispose

Reverse logistics hierarchy – least to most wasteful

1.  Reduce
2.  Reuse
3.  Recycle
4.  Recover energy during disposal
5.  Dispose in responsible landfill

Remanufacturing: worn-out products are restored to like-new condition.

Recycling: reintroduction of partial processed product

Repurpose: Take something and use it for something else not originally intended

Recovery: Collection of used and discarded products, components, and materials.

Asset recovery: Cost-effective classification and recovery of usable raw material from product returns, obsolete, or excess goods, scrap and waste.

Donations: many companies do this even if they reach their tax limit

Scrap: material outside of specifications and possessing characteristics that make rework impractical

Salvage: property that, because of its worn, damaged, deteriorated, or incomplete condition or nature, has no prospect of sale or use without major repairs or alterations, but that has some value in excess of its scrap value.

Closed-loop systems: system that accounts for the return flow of products for reuse, asset recovery, or recycling in a way that is cost-effective and maximizes returns.

- Beer kegs: full of beer when sold and can be returned and refilled for a price

- Redbox: free-standing movie rental kiosk, reuses discs and cases

- Printer ink cartridges: when empty, are sent via prepaid mailers back to the company for cleaning, inspection and refilling.

- Commercial tire casings sent to a tire retreader who adds new treads

Kodak single-use camera closed-loop supply process:

1.  Supplier sends materials to Kodak
2.  Kodak produces single-use cameras, shipped to retailers
3.  Retailers display the cameras and sell to customers
4.  Customers use the cameras to take photographs and then return them with the film inside to a photo finisher
5.  Photo finisher develops film and creates prints and are sent to the customer
6.  Phot finish sends the used empty cameras in batches to a collection center
7.  Collection center sorts the used cameras, shipped to a subcontractor
8.  Subcontractor cleans and disassembles the cameras, replaces parts as needed and completes final inspection of the cameras, which are shipped to Kodak.
9.  Kodak reloads camera bodies with film and ships cameras to retailers.

Advantages to forward and reverse flow closed loops (example above):

- Capture a significant portion of the product’s original value

- Used products are recycled and therefore do not become part of landfills

- Easier for the manufacturer to balance supply and demand

Optimizing reverse logistics

- Many firms do not want to deal with product returns

- Managing reverse logistics

o Weighing PROs and CONs of establishing its own returns center or using a third party.

o Senior management must have buy-in to the chosen strategy.

o High-level finance/IT directors should be involved.

o Reducing cycle times is crucial

o Returns should be forecasted

o Dispositions of returns need to be done consistently

Dekitting: removal of accessories or parts kits from a product and returning either the kit or the main product without the kit to the store. May also refer to the allowance of the resale of kits or products without their parts kits.

Key technologies:

- The internet

- Enterprise resources planning

- Electronic data interchange

- Internet of things

- Radio frequency identification

- Returns management system

- Reverse payments process

o 20 to 30 inventory turns is a goal for collection center

- Blockchain: acts as a distributed ledger that can reduce under and over-ordering, parts compatibility

Challenges

- Forecasting volumes

- Storage

- Cost

- Traceability

Capacity Planning and Demand Management

Forecasting: business function that attempts to predict sales and use of products so they can be purchased or manufactured in appropriate quantities in advance.

Forecasting horizons

- Long-term: 3+ years, new products, retire others, enter or exit markets, plan facilities and capacity for supply, manufacturing, transportation, warehousing and retail.

- Medium-term: 1-2 years, budgets, production planning, shorter-term capacity planning (hiring drivers, warehouse employees or negotiating contract extensions).

- Short-term: less than 1 year, what to purchase or product, logistics services to schedule

Nature of forecasting: consumer demand volatility creates uncertainty within supply chain

Bias: consistent deviation from the mean in one direction (high or low).

Forecasting must create more value than it costs to gather data.

Two principles of forecasting:

- Aggregate forecasts, such as families or groups of products are more reliable than granular forecasts of individual items

- Forecasting into the future becomes inherently less reliable.

How to improve forecasting accuracy:

- Check data sources and data input methods and results for accuracy and reliability.

- Use demand history than sales history.

o Sales history – sales returns + unfulfilled orders + drop ships + estimated loss of sales due to stockouts

- Use end-consumer demand rather than DC demand

- Include a margin of error in units or monetary amounts with each forecast to get people used to looking at accuracy.

- Adhere to organizational targets for forecast quality and acceptable error rates and adjust methods when forecast is missing its targets.

- Track the accuracy of forecasts before and after expert modifications

- Keep forecast models as simple as possible.

Bullwhip effect: an extreme change in the supply position upstream, generated by a small change in demand downstream.

Factors affecting demand

- Trends: general upward or downward movement of a variable overtime

o Linear

o Exponential

- Cycles: shifts in demand lasting longer than one year

- Seasonality: predictable repetitive pattern of demand measured within a year

- Random variation: fluctuation in data that is caused by uncertain or random occurrences

o Common cause: several factors, not modelled due for simplicity’s sake

o Special cause: assignable

▪ Trends

▪ Seasonality

▪ Causes

- Promotions: discounts or advertising

o Promotions explain 50-80% sales variation

- Minimum quantity requirements: smallest amount of product that can be ordered

Forecasting process:

1.  Determine the purpose of the forecast
2.  Determine level of aggregation and what will be forecasted

1.  Family, product or SKU

4.  Determine the time horizon
5.  Visualize the data
6.  Choose the forecasting method or model
7.  Prepare the data
8.  Test the forecast using historical data
9.  Forecast
10.  Perform sales and operations planning
11.  Periodically review and improve models for accuracy

Qualitative forecasting techniques:

- Personal insight

- Sales force estimates

- Panel consensus

- Market research

- Visionary forecasting

- Delphi method: survey experts

Quantitative forecasting techniques: historical demand data is used to project future demand.

- Time series: projects historical data patterns into the future

o Simple moving average

o Weighted moving average

o Exponential smoothing

- Visualizing: able to spot seasonality

- Deseasonalizing: generating a seasonal index

![Table
Description automatically generated](file:///C:/Users/Jordan/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image013.gif)

Simple and weighted moving averages, exponential smoothing

- Simple moving average: average of demand from several preceding periods

- Weighted moving averages: places weights on periods being averaged, putting emphasis on more recent periods

- Exponential smoothing: Involves weighting, minimizes lag from trend shift

![](file:///C:/Users/Jordan/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image014.gif)

Reseasonalizing: multiplying the deseasonalized data by given periods season index

Associative forecasting (casual, correlation, explanatory, or extrinsic): uses one or more variables that are believed to affect demand in order to forecast future demand.

- Predictor = independent variable

- Element being predicted = dependent variable

Simple regression: y = mx + b

Multiple regression: has 1+ predictive variables. EX: marketing spend added to roofing sales analysis.

Distribution channels

- Supplier > customer

- Supplier > DC > manufacturer > business

- Supplier > DC > manufacturer > DC > customer

- Supplier > DC > manufacturer > DC > wholesaler > retailer > customer

Production factors

- Product volume capacity

- Product mixes

- Costs of regular vs customized services

- Delivery times

- Flexibility of changeovers

- Agile (scaling up and down)

Production types

- Make to stock: inventory end units

- Assemble to order: bill of materials

- Make to order: raw material

Retail distribution channel

- Manufacturer’s DC

- Retailer’s warehouse

- 3PL

- Wholesaler

- Direct delivery via owned vehicles, carrier or parcel service

- Retailer direct pickup

Business-to-business: conducted over internet between companies

- Commodities: command a higher price when service reliability or faster lead times can be guaranteed

- Specialized products: changing price, or leas times depending on demand

o Make to order: reduces inventory

o Engineer to order: raw material only ordered after design

Supplier to customer

- Goods do not flow through seller’s warehouse

- End customer may pay for shipping

Omni-channel distribution

- Retail location

- Shop online

Channel selection

- Reliability / on-time delivery

- Negotiating minimum order sizes, bulk purchase price breaks, or unit types

- Packaging for faster or more organized retail store distribution

- Delivery within narrow windows for cross-docking

- Minimizing and passing on cast savings in the form of lower prices

- Adding more value than cost as perceived by end customers

- Able to quickly communicate service failures, damage reports, and inventory levels

Interpreting forecasts: errors lead to higher costs

Forecast error: difference between actual and forecast demand

Absolute percentage error: A-F/A

Forecast accuracy: 1-forecast error as a percentage

Mean absolute deviation: absolute period errors/# of periods

Mean squared error (MSE): Magnifies errors, makes then positive

 MSE = (sum of errors for each period)^2 / number of periods

Mean absolute percentage error: ratio of errors to the actual demand

 MAPE = (each month absolute value) / 12 (months) *100 = %

Tracking signal: Sum of forecast errors / mean absolute deviatION

- Companies will set a target value (let’s say 4) so anything beyond that triggers a forecast review

Measuring by SKU

- Forecast bias

o if signal is always negative, we are over-forecasting

o If positive, under-forecasting

- Suitability of the forecasting method:

o If it remains in a specified range (4 in this case), method is working correctly

Forecasting exception management

- Verify logic of forecast

- Verify data and assumptions, input errors

- Product groupings

- Note forecast assumptions separately

- If forecast is deemed valid, act upon it (decrease or increase capacity)

Logistics demand forecasting starts with sales forecast which will be translated to staffing, equipment, and contracted services

3-to-5 year forecast done for strategic planning will help logistics professionals determine size and number of warehouses.

Annual forecast determines staffing levels and equipment.

Operational weekly forecasting determines warehouse worker scheduling.

Forecasting tools

o Performance metrics and targets: specifying targets enables control

- Production planning:

o Chase: increases/decreases production to match seasonal demand, requiring flexible workforce and idle equipment at times

o Level: produces a steady amount, inventory accumulates during low demand periods.

o Hybrid: mixes chase and level, outsources near seasonal peaks

o Production rates

▪ Too low = overheard > profit

▪ High = overtime and quality issues destroy profit

o ![Diagram
Description automatically generated](file:///C:/Users/Jordan/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image020.jpg)

- Communicating demand

o Demand sensing: collecting data on actual orders

▪ POS

▪ Open orders per period

o Communicate soon and regularly with a structure

- Influencing demand:

o Product management, marketing and sales

o External balancing: price and adjustments in lead time

▪ Price increases will turn customers to alternatives

▪ Price decreases help with surplus inventory

▪ Bulk purchase discounts

▪ Payment terms

▪ Credit approval policies

▪ Increase lead times: may turn away customers if too long

▪ Positive contribution margin: net profit increases while sales increases. Too much variety can be unsustainable.

- Managing and prioritizing demand

o Policy: indicate who is allowed to manage and prioritize demand

▪ Delegating to sales will create conflicts as they are naturally motivated by customers’ best interests

o Process: Fulfill demand when it is feasible and will increase marginal profits

▪ Fulfilling demand later

▪ Delaying other orders to meet customer’s date

▪ Offering substitute

o Time frame: change priority only if there is an impact to profitability

Constraint management: (EX) warehouse capacity when a new product line is offered while still working to sell off the old product line

1.  Identify constraint
2.  Exploit constraint: making quick improvements with existing resources

1.  Finding mostly empty bays
2.  Eliminating obsolete inventory
3.  Slower shipping modes for less in-demand items

4.  Subordinating: ensure other processes are arranged

1.  Picking and outbound shipping is fully staffed

Forecast: per-period demand plan for individual item

Customer orders: actual demand

Projected available balance: running sum of on-hand inventory – requirements plus scheduled receipts and planned orders

Available to promise: uncommitted portion of a company’s inventory and planned production maintained in the master schedule to support customer-order promising.

Order promising: making a delivery commitment

Master production schedule: reflects anticipated build schedule.

Interplant demand: one plant’s need for a part is produced by another plant within the same organization

Time fence: policy to limit changes in operations during a period.

- Frozen: capacity and materials are committed to specific orders

- Slushy: there is room to negotiate in the form of tradeoffs. Master scheduler can make those decisions.

- Liquid: All changes are permissible as long as they don’t violate the limits set in the production plan or by the policy in the sales and operations plan.

Projected available balance = beginning inventory + additional supply – demand

Available to promise (ATP): inventory on-hand + items scheduled to arrive

Material requirements planning: uses bill of material data, inventory and master production to schedule to calculate requirements for materials.

Dependent demand: directly related to or derived from the bill of material structure for other items of end product.

Sourcing and procurement

Sourcing: process of identifying a company that provides a needed good or service

Procurement: planning, purchasing, inventory control, traffic, receiving, incoming inspection, and salvage operations

Purchasing strategy

- Centralized: determined at hq, doesn’t account for local demand

- Decentralized: more suppliers, fewer economies of scale, ideal for multiple product lines within divisions

- Hybrid

Spend analysis: balancing consolidation and economies of scale with diversification and minimizing risk.

Make-or-buy decisions: cost of making in-house vs the global market landed cost

Quadrant model:

- Generics: low risk and low value

- Contracts for the international sale of goods

- Trading partner agreement describes all facets of their business together

  
Contract types

- Cost-based: price goods or services tired to the cost of key inputs or other economic factors as interest rates

- Cost-plus-fixed-fee contract: seller is paid for costs specified as allowable in the contract plus a stipulated fixed fee

- Firm fixed-price contract: seller is paid a set piece without regard to costs

Incentive contract: where buyer and seller agree to a target cost and maximum price. Cost savings below the target are shared between buyer and seller. If actual exceeds target, cost overrun is shared between buyer and seller.

Incentive arrangements: allows for the sharing of the cost responsibility between the buyer and seller. Incentives are incorporated into the contract to motivate the supplier to improve its performance – target cost, target profit, and the sharing agreement.

Cost-plus-incentive-fee contract: contract in which the seller is paid for costs specified as allowable in the contract plus a profit, provided certain provisions are met.

Fixed-price-incentive-fee contract: contract in which the seller is paid a set price and can earn an additional profit if certain stipulations are met.

CRM – customer relationship management

Lifetime customers:

- 70-80% of customers provide little or not profit

- 40% cost to maintain

Analysis of firm’s customers:

- Top tier customers

o Place large or regular orders

o Easier to deal with

o Pay on time

- Middle tier customers

o Large, but less frequent orders

o Uncertain or fickle about their desires

- Low tier customers

o Small, infrequent orders

o Do not pay on-time

o More warranty or claims

Buying experience:

- Communications

- Time

- Dependability

- Flexibility

80-20 rule: 80% of sales or costs come from 20% of the possible causes

Implementing the CRM process:

1.  Sort customers into profitability tiers

1.  Single allocation criteria: cost of direct materials, labor and overhead for each customer
2.  Activity-based costing: How, how much, what and when a customer order:

 i. Operating profit contribution: gross profit – (invoices x average cost/invoice)

3.  Cost to serve costs of each business activities

2.  Determine service levels

1.  Different product/service packages given to different segments within a tier, providing the best service for higher-profitability customers
2.  Same product/service package offered to everyone with varying quality and service levels by profitability tier
3.  Same product/service package and the same service level can be offered to all customers – easiest to administer, creates higher risk of losing profitable customers

4.  Service level steps

1.  Identify what each profitability tier values
2.  Categorize service components: pre-transaction, transaction, post-transaction
3.  Prioritize elements of customer service by profit tier or segment
4.  Benchmark against competitors to establish relative service level
5.  Perform gap analysis
6.  Design product/service packages that will meet or exceed minimum service
7.  Establish service level metrics, targets and monitoring/controlling procedures
8.  Monitor and control

Decoupling: separates supply from demand so customer demand can be filled from independent inventories.

Economy of scale: larger volumes of production reduce unit cost

Bullwhip effect

- Occurs in push / make – to – stock systems

- Delays in communication from end customer data result in variability and extra inventory on-hand

- Supply variability also affects this as well

Level of service: percent of orders satisfied by production schedule to satisfy customers’ requested delivery dates and quantities

- Make to stock calculation variations

o % of orders picked complete from stock

o % of line items picked complete

o % of total dollar demand picked complete

Fill rate: % of time units were shipped on schedule

Stockout: lack of materials, components or finished goods

On-time schedule performance: % of meeting the customer’s originally negotiated delivery date.

Stakeholder perceptions of inventory

- Inventory shrinkage: reductions in actual quantities of stock due to scrap, theft, deterioration, evaporation (etc)

- Financial managers want the value of inventory lower (to improve return on assets)

- Operations managers want higher inventory levels to improve productivity

- Sales and marketing want to maximize customer service levels and inventory, so objectives are not missed

- Customers want the right product at the right time, so they want high service levels

Inventory types

- Operating: what is needed to satisfy forecast demand

- Excess: will be used within the planning time frame

- Surplus: Beyond planning time frame and would not have been ordered in the first place

- Inactive: wasted assets that drags down profitability

o Subaru still holds on to “dead” SKUs to ensure high customer service levels

Inventory levels may be too high for the following reasons:

- Unreliable suppliers

- Lack of confidence in forecast

- Demand characteristics that make forecasting difficult

- Production problems causing delays or rework

Reducing the product cycle time

- Examine each step to find efficiencies and compress time

- Reducing inventory lead times and safety stock throughout the pipeline\

o Order sooner and using JIT repeatedly

- Faster transportation options

Functions of inventory

- Serves demand for raw materials and finished goods

- Smooths the impact of fluctuations in supply and demand

- Buffers against uncertainty in supply and demand

- Creates cost-savings opportunities through enabling economies of scale or various hedging tactics

Lot size: amount of a particular item that is ordered from the plant or a supplier

Cycle stock: depletes gradually as customer orders are fulfilled

Pipeline stock: inventory in-progress and in-transit to DC. Has impact on:

- Order transmission

- Order processing

- Scheduling

- Shipping

- Transportation

- Receiving

- Stocking

- Review time

Anticipation inventories: additional inventory above basic pipeline stock to cover demand

Issues with aligning supply and demand

- Geographical specialization

- Decoupling supply and demand

- Seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand

Inventory threats

- Forecast may not have considered the impact of improved economic conditions, thus understating demand

- Shipments may be delayed in transit due to weather, traffic, carrier issues, or other causes.

- Product defect may require replacement and may draw inventory down unexpectedly.

Safety stock: planned to be inventory to protect against fluctuations in demand or supply

Hedge inventory: inventory build up for unplanned speculations like riots or strikes

Economies of scale within supply chain:

- Procurement – when suppliers offer volume discounts

- Production – when runs are longer

- Transportation – larger order = higher economical tier

Inventory costs

- Acquisition

o Unit

▪ Material

▪ Labor to produce

▪ Overhead

- Staffing

- Systems

- Training

- Parts and supplies

- Disposal costs

- Labor, parts, waste and supplies associated with shifting production

▪ Forklifts

▪ Tools

▪ Equipment labor

▪ Packaging

- Carrying cost: percentage of the dollar value of inventory per unit of time

o Capital

▪ Borrowing to purchase inventory

▪ Opportunity costs -purchase inventory vs retiring debt

o Storage

▪ Utilities

▪ Staffing

▪ Facility

▪ Equipment maintenance

▪ Security

▪ Owned buildings

o Insurance

o Taxes

o In-transit cost

- Stockout

o Loss of immediate revenue

o Damaged customer relations

o Damaged business reputations

Backorder: unfilled customer order or commitment that is past due

Expedite: decrease lead time of an order

Order cancellation effects:

1.  Erosion of the customer relationship
2.  Reputation suffers
3.  End customer finds alternatives, thus ending future orders

Module 6 Section B: Inventory Control, Strategy, and Policy

Types of demand:

- Independent: determined by forecasting, safety stocks usually required

- Dependent: requirement for independent demand inventory

o Vertical: SKU required for the production of another SKU

o Horizontal: combined to form one SKU (kitting)

- Dual: Same parts used to manufacture (dependent) and in repair (independent)

Fixed order quantity system: triggers re-ordering at a point

Order point: set inventory level where, if the total stock on hand plus on order falls below that point, action is taken to replenish the stock.

Order point = anticipated demand x lead time

- EX: Mobile phones

o Demand = 200 / day

o Lead time = 3 days

o Order point = 200 * 300 = 600

Lot-for-lot: generates planned orders in quantities equal to the net requirements in each period

Point of sale: relief of inventory and computation of sales data at the time and place of sales through bar coding or magnetic media and equipment

Master production schedule provides the time-phased information required to know how much to reorder

Economic order quantity: type of fixed order quantity model that determines the amount of an item to be purchased or manufactured at one time

EOQ = Square root ( (2 * Annual usage in units *Order costs) / (annual carrying cost % * unit cost))

Exceptions to EOQ

- Quantity discounts: unit cost decreases as the lot size increases, carrying costs mya increase as well

- Joint replenishment: coordinating the lot sizing and order release decision for related items

- Transportation costs

Before using EOQ:

- Qualitative judgment must be done after calculating EOQ

- EOQ is indicative, but not precise

- More demand variability = less validity of EOQ

Fixed order period approach: method of inventory planning that measures actual inventory levels at regular intervals of time

![](file:///C:/Users/Jordan/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image028.jpg)

Min-max system:

- Min = order point (minimum amount to demand during replenishment lead time)

- Max = order up to point (max safety stock buffer)

- Recommended when sum of available and on-order inventory is at or below the min

- Not used for external suppliers, only internal DC transfers

Just-In-Time (JIT): keep inventory low with fast transit

Kanban: standard containers or lot sizes with a single card attached to each

Managing exceptions, anomalies, constraints, and conditions of uncertainty

- Effects of uncertainty

o Safety lead time: protect against fluctuations

- Calculating standard deviation in Units

o SD = measurement of dispersion of data of a variable

Overstocks: supply in excess of demand

Mean absolute deviation: average of the absolute values

Cycle service level: the probability of not having a stockout in one ordering cycle

Vendor managed inventory: businesses share inventory management responsibilities with their suppliers

- Covered products defined

- Order points and order quantities defined

- What data is shared

Consigned stocks: inventories that are in the possession of customers, dealers, agents and brokers, but remain the property of the manufacturer by agreement

- Customer pays for inventory only when withdrawn from inventory

ABC Analysis of inventory: classification of a group of items in decreasing order of annual dollar volume

- Determine levels of safety stock

- Provide appropriate levels of inventory counting

- Locate SKUs in individual warehouses

- Check for expired items

- Set service level targets

Dead stock: stock that has no sales within a 12 month period

Other factors to consider than ABD analysis

- Profit margin

- Customer importance

- Relationships to other items

- Velocity or turns

Transaction points:

- Order is received and checked

- Defective portion of the order may be returned to the supplier

o Remainder of the order is put into inventory

- WIP stock is issued to a production point

- Loss of stock through waste is recorded

- Picking of finished goods from inventory is recorded

Creating an effective inventory transaction system:

- Handling policies

- Development of processes and tools

- Training

- Commitment to auditing

Continuous review system: checked whenever change in inventory level occurs

Visual review system: simple inventory control system where the inventory re-ordering is based on looking at the amount of inventory on hand

Two-bin inventory system: working and excess

Inventory accuracy: usually 95% to 99%

Cycle counting: inventory counted on a regular basis

- ABC: A items are counted more often compared to B and C

Approaches to cycle counting:

- Zone method: conducts count area by area until complete

- Doing counts before orders are put away

- Counting during picking

- Frequency of cycle count triggered by the number of items shipped

Days inventory outstanding = inventory on hand / average daily use

Weeks of supply: inventory on hand / average weekly use

Order fill rate: number of items or dollars shipped on schedule for a specific time period

Inventory reduction methods:

- Review of demand forecasting methods

- Re-analysis of usage and lead times

- Recalculation of order quantities

- Reduction of safety stock level

- Application of ABC classification

- More accurate or frequent cycle counting

- Monitoring of supplier deliveries

- Vendor-managed or consignment inventory

Inventory turnover: number of times inventory turns over per year

3 ways to estimate cost

- Economies of scale: average cost per unit decreases

- Economies of density: lane specific, increases capacity utilization through consolidation

- Economies of scope: average cost of a carrier decreases as carrier increases services

Transportation documentation

- Master BOL: issued by carriers that are vessel owners

- House bill of lading: issued by a non-vessel operating common carrier, consolidator, or freight forwarder. Between customer and a forwarder

- Waybill: list of items included in the cargo by the shipper, condition of the carge, name of consignee (confirmed by shipper)

o Used when recipient of cargo is known

o Cargo will not be sold of traded during transport

o Negotiable transport document is not needed

o VS BOL: goods are being sold, laws require BOL, letter of credit terms require that a negotiable title document be used

- Freight bill: carrier’s invoice

Less developed countries rely on manual unloading of ships by stevedores, who balance smaller loads on their head and shoulders.

Modes:

- Dry bulk: coal, grain, ores, scrap iron. Complete vessel-load lots

- Liquid bulk: petroleum carried by owned or leased tankers

- Parcel tankers: 50+ liquids

- Dry cargo ships (automobile carriers): up to 8500 CEUs (car equivalent)

- River barges: heavy bulk cargo

China passenger trains have priority over freight

Factors impacting international logistics

- Selling complementary products together

- Proliferation of alternative options for carriers

- Common presence of substitute products

Substitutability: when a buyer can purchase similar products from different suppliers.

- Reduce stockouts

- Slightly more carrying costs

Demand elasticity = % change in quantity / % change in price

Transportation demand is inelastic

Five components that impact demand

- Capabilities of the carrier must match freight requirements

- Time in transit: between manufacturing and stocking, releases working capital and reduces inventory costs

- Reliability of transit times: stockout costs can be minimized

- Direct service: can reduce cost, time in transit and improve reliability due to not using a partner carrier

- Carrier’s record

Market structure impact on pricing:

- Late 1880s: government began regulating transportation business practices

- Deregulated during mid-1970 through the 90’s

Deregulated market structures:

- Open competition: large unrestricted entry

- Oligopoly: several large sellers of the same services

- Monopoly: one provider with no competitors

- Competitive monopoly: several small competitive companies, 1 large one dominating lane or service

Pricing strategies:

- Cost of service pricing: prices determined by using the average or marginal costs

- Value of service: profit-maximizing approach, carriers charge based on the product’s demand traits

International trade theories

- Absolute advantage: cheaper to trade than to do it yourself

- Comparative advantage: better to trade if marginal AND opportunity cost is lower

- Heckscher-Ohlin Factor endowment theory: country will have a comparative advantage due to one of four factors: labor, capital, land, or entrepreneurship

- International product life cycle

o Designed to satisfy market need in a developed country

o Product is exported to more countries after 1st country

o Demand increases, imitations begin

o Focus shifts to lowered products costs

- Cluster theory: competitive advantage can be gained when close to suppliers and competitors

- Logistics cluster theory: logistics hubs attract manufacturers

Consular invoice: special invoice used for goods being sent to the importer’s country. Importing country’s consulate provide the stationary.

Import documentation purposes

 Ensuring that only quality products are imported

 Calculating the correct tariff classifications and products’ value

 Protecting the interests of local imports from dishonest exporters

 Limiting the volume of certain commodity imports

Certification of origin: document attesting to a shipment’s country of origin

Carnet: temporary admission for passing through a country rather than being imported into it

**Export Documentation**

Shipper’s export declaration (SED): export/import document prepared by the shipper before the shipment can be exported and presented to a government authority of the country. Specifies value, weight, destination

EEI (the export declaration) was introduced in 2014 to streamline processes

Declaration for free entry of returned products: if good has value added prior to its return, duty may be due on either the fair market value of the labor that was added or the item itself

Export license: document received from a governmental agency authorizing a certain quantity of an export to be sent to a given country.

**International Transportation Documents**

US Export Administration Regulations requires a “Destination control statement” be included on the invoice, bill of lading, air waybill or other export control document

International bill of lading: bill of lading used in international trade to help ensure exports are paid and imports receive the promised goods

- Acts as a contract between the shipper and the transportation carrier to transport and deliver goods

- Signature of the carrier is the shipper’s proof that the carrier received the goods

- Signature of the consignee at delivery serves as a receipt for the goods

- B/L is the basis for filing freight claims

Ocean bill of lading: contract between an ocean carrier and a shipper arranging for carriage of freight. Shipper is responsible for all losses other than negligence on the part of the ocean carrier

Two forms of B/Ls related to the quality of the goods shipped can be issued by the receiver after a thorough inspection:

- Clean bill of lading, which indicates goods were in good condition

- Claused (soiled or foul) bill of lading, which indicates that the products transported were damaged in some manner

Waybills

- Air Waybill (AWB): bill of lading for transporting domestic or international freight by air

- Road waybill (standard truckload BOL)

- Rail waybill

Packing list: list showing merchandise packed, a copy of which is sent to the consignee to help verify the shipment

5.  Check for prohibited articles
6.  Goods match invoice

3.  If there are problems, load can be held until corrected, exported or destroyed

7.  Customs determines classification and corresponding duties owned on goods based on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. When the duty is paid, shipment is “liquidated”
8.  Customs releases goods to importer, who coordinates the last leg of the journey

1.  If importer wants to postpone duty payment, goods may be stored in customs bonded warehouse for up to 5 years or brought to FTZ

Customs brokers:licensed firms or individuals by customs that facilitate clearance

Duty: tax levied by a government on the importation, exportation, or use and consumption of goods. Based on:

- Type of goods being imported, classified according to the harmonized system of classification

- Value of goods imported, based on invoice

- Value of any “duty assist” given by the importer to the manufacturer (importer provides the tooling needed to produce the product)

- The country from which the products are imported

Harmonized system classification codes: internationally standardized description of goods that uses a system of numbers to provide increasingly detailed classifications and descriptions

- 98% of world trade recognizes this system

- Up to 10 digits

- First 6 - root

- Last 4 - country specific subcategories

Harmonized Tariff Schedule: US International Trade Commission’s mechanism by which international tariffs are standardized. Importers and exporters classify goods moved across international borders.

Valuation: goods being shipped determines a variety of other charges and tariffs.

- Landed value:

- Cost of packaging

*Incoterms® 2010 recommend explicitly stating who will pay for the insurance in a contract or quote. Incoterms® trade terms indicate where risk/liability is transferred but do not actually obligate the buyer or seller to carry insurance except when explicitly noted in the term. In most cases, companies will maintain cargo insurance as a backup.

Incoterms definitions (all modes):

- Ex Works (EWX): buyer pays all transportation costs and bears all risks for transporting the goods to their destination

- Free Carrier (FCA): seller delivers goods into the carrier’s custody. Risk passes from seller to buyer. Buyer pays for transportation from the place named in incoterm. Seller is responsible for correcting and paying for any problems or costs of clearing customs

- Carriage Paid To (CPT): seller pays for the freight to the named point of destination. The passing of risk occurs when the goods have been delivered into the custody of the first carrier

- Carriage and insurance paid to (CIP): passing of risk occurs when the goods have been delivered into the custody of the first carrier. From this point, buyer bears all risk and any additional costs. Seller pays for insurance and is required to clear the goods for export

- Delivered at Terminal (DAT): seller delivers the goods at a named terminal or destination. If possible, both parties should try to agree at which point risk is transferred.

- Delivered at Place (DAP): Seller delivers the goods to the buyer, who assumes responsibility for their unloading at a named destination.

- Delivered Duty Paid (DDP): seller pays for all transportation costs, bears all risk until goods have been delivered, and pays for the duty

Incoterms for sea and inland waterway transport:

- Free Alongside Ship (FAS): seller pays for transportation of the goods to the port of shipment. Buyer pays loading costs, freight, insurance, unloading costs, and transportation to the port of destination. Risk is passed once goods are delivered to pier at the port of shipment

- Free on Board (FOB): only used for ocean shipping. Better for bulk, break-bulk cargo, or roll on roll off cargo. Responsibility shifts when freight is on vessel. Exporters pay for packaging, shipping to the port of departure, stevedore loading costs, customs clearing, and exporting country pre-shipment inspection. Importer pays for ocean carrier costs, inbound customs costs.

- Cost of Freight (CFR): seller pays for costs and freight of the goods to the destination port. Buyer pays for the insurance and transportation from the port of discharge (POD). Risk of loss shifts when the goods are on board at the port of shipment. CFR is not used for air or land transport.

- Cost, insurance and Freight (CIF): selling price includes the cost of the goods, freight or transport costs, and marine insurance. Under CIF, seller must obtain in transferable for a marine insurance policy to cover the risks of transit. Seller’s responsibility ends when the goods have been delivered on board the shipping vessel at the port of shipment. If seller wants to end responsibility to end when goods are delivered into the hands of a carrier prior to the goods passing the ship’s rail.

**Methods of Payment**

Cash in advance: payment by the importer to the exporter before the exporter ships the goods, providing the maximum protection to the exporter and no protection to the importer.

Letters of credit: formal letter in which a bank assures the seller that the buyer is good for the purchase price of the foods and that the bank will therefore honor the buyer’s checks to the seller up to that amount.

- Revocable: pro forma document used to prepare an irrevocable letter of credit

- Irrevocable: type cannot be canceled by the issues bank unless the exporter agrees to that decision

- Confirmed irrevocable: foreign bank provides the letter of credit. Guaranteed by a bank in the exporter’s country and is therefore more expensive

Letter of Credit process:

1.  L/C issued. After agreeing to the terms of sale, the buyer/importer goes to its bank and gets a letter of credit demonstrating that the bank has faith in the buyer’s/importer’s ability to pay the purchase price
2.  Buyer’s bank notifies the seller’s bank that the L/C has been issued. Assures the seller’s bank that it can honor drafts from the seller up to the amount of the purchase price. Locks in currency rate.
3.  Seller ships the cargo.
4.  Seller asks its banker for money
5.  Seller’s bank asks buyer’s banker for money
6.  Buyer’s bank waits for cargo (perhaps)
7.  Everyone gets paid

Bill of exchange payment: promissory note that the importer uses to formally acknowledge its debt to the exporter

- Types of drafts

- Date: 30, 60, 90 days after date of shipment

- Time: 30, 60, 90 days after importer signs the draft

- Sight: seller retains title of the goods until the goods until the importer makes the payment and then receive the bill of lading or air waybill

**Open Account (high risk to seller)**

Open account payment: method of payment for goods shipped in advance of payment, in which the buyer or importer sends the seller or exporter an invoice requesting payment by a certain date

Exporter sends an invoice to the importer once the products have shipped:

- Payment due dates

- Number of days at which importer will be considered past due

- Interest rate charges on late payments

- Discounts for early payment(s)

- Cost of risk insurance

**Currency and Tax Considerations**

Three options for currency:

- Convertibility: ease at which one currency can be converted into another.

- Risk of fluctuation

**Reducing transaction explode through hedging**

- Forward market hedge: exporter would purchase the necessary currency to over the foreign payable based on difference in the exchange rates of the two countries

- Money market hedging: firm protecting its exposure (exporter/seller) will borrow money from a bank in the importer’s country that is an amount equal to the present value of the pay for goods sold.

Transfer pricing: selling a product to another division of the company, usually at market rate “arm’s-length customer” which is straight-forward

- Selling intracompany goods to subsidiary in lower-tax country is highly regulated, known as base erosion and profit shifting

- Companies often sell to free trade zones

Foreign/free trade zone (FTZ): designated area within a country that is outside the country. Material is not subject to duties and taxes until material is moved out.

- Encourages exports

- Useful if rates on tariffs are higher than the rates on final products

- Re-exported materials owe no duties

- Customs duties and federal excise taxes on imports are deferred

- Foreign and domestic goods that are to be exported are exempt from state and local inventory taxes

- Merchandise can be held at the FTZ indefinitely

- Goods can be inspected and tested before paying import duties

Companies that have FTZs: Caterpillar, BMW, Ryder Group, GE, Kawasaki Motors
